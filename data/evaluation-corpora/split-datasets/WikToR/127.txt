Santa Fe is a fifth class municipality in the province of Romblon, Philippines. Legend says that the barrio was named after a beautiful, lovely daughter of one of its early settlers of the place. She was so loved and revered by the locals that they named her Santa Fe, and in her death, they named the place after her. However, in Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas by Spanish conquistador Miguel de Loarca, it states that the barrio was named after Santa Fe in the province of Granada in Spain. Its first settlers were Onhan-speaking Negritos from Panay Island who emigrated to Tablas as early as 1730. During the Spanish colonial period, Santa Fe was a barrio of neighboring Looc town until 1855 when it was established as a separate pueblo or town. It was abolished and reverted into a barrio again in 1868. In 1892, the Spaniards restored Santa Fe's municipal status, which would remain until the American colonial period. Santa Fe was one 11 municipalities created in Romblon when civilian government was established in the province. However, on 10 March 1917, it was abolished and reverted once more into a barrio of Looc. On 8 January 1940, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, authored by Romblon congressman Leonardo Festin, the municipality of Looc was abolished and incorporated into a new special municipality called Tablas. Hence, Santa Fe became a barrio of this special municipality.
