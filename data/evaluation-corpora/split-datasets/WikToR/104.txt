This forced the inhabitants of Santiago, Cabadbaran to transfer to barrio Jagupit. In 1936, the same Aciga River wrought damage which made the inhabitants decide to transfer at the foot of the hill, particularly at Sitio Paypay, which was inhabited by two groups of natives-the Manobos and the Mamanwas, then. The construction of the national highway, which passes thru sitio Paypay, lured more people to settle in the place. Towards the end of 1936, thru a bill sponsored by the late Congressman Calo, the name Paypay was changed to Santiago in honor of Senior Santiago or Saint James.
