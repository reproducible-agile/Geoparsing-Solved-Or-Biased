Pedernales, Texas was an early settlement of German immigrants in Gillespie County, and was part of the Adelsverein colonization of Texas. No trace of the settlement remains today. It is located 7 miles (11 km) southwest of Fredericksburg near what is now Texas State Highway 16. The Pedernales school was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1993, Marker number 10095. In 1846, Wilhelm Victor Keidel moved to Fredericksburg, becoming Gillespie County's first physician, and in 1848 the county's first Chief Justice. He was one of the individuals who signed the petition to create Gillespie County On December 15, 1847. Keidel relocated 7 miles (11 km) southwest of Fredericksburg to the banks of the Pedernales River and founded a settlement he named Pedernales. For any settlers who would relocate with him to the settlement, he agreed to give them free medical care. Keidel became the first leader of the community. Among the other early residents were photographer and landscape artist Hermann Lungkwitz and his brother-in-law and fellow painter Friedrich Richard Petri. After the Bettina community failed circa 1848, Jacob Kuechler and his wife Marie Petri Kuechler moved to Pedernales, to join the family business. By 1850 the settlement had forty-four residents of German descent.
