Miami is a community in southern Manitoba, Canada which was formed in 1885. It supports a K-12 school and has a curling rink and a skating rink. It lies 100 kilometres southwest of Winnipeg in the Rural Municipality of Thompson. Miami also has a well trained fire department. Members of the department are trained to a minimum Level I fire fighting certification with the Office of the Fire Commissioner. The Miami Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service has about 24 active members. The town also has a well trained and well equipped EMS Unit that works in conjunction with the surrounding hospitals. In 2005, the town was the victim of a mass street sign theft. All of the town's signs, a total of 44, were stolen just before Christmas Day; total replacement cost was about $7,000 CAD. It just so happened that same night a house fire was reported and no street signs were available for directions. Most of the streets in the community are named after prominent past residents or pioneers. Miami was used in a controversial prank contest by Winnipeg radio station Classic Rock 97.5 FM (CJKR) morning man Scruff Connors in 1995. The radio station ran a contest for an all expenses paid trip to Miami to watch the Super Bowl, but did not mention that they were referring to Miami, Manitoba and not the one in Florida. Local media reported that some participants had considered lawsuits over the prank. Because of the negative backlash of the prank, CJKR terminated Connors' contract within days of the incident.
