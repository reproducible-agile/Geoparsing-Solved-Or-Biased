Arcadia is an unincorporated community located in Sullivan County, Tennessee, just outside Kingsport's eastern city limits. Arcadia, originally known as the Reedy Creek Settlement, was one of the earliest settlements in present-day Tennessee. Daniel Boone's Wilderness Road ran through this community in 1775. Arcadia is listed in the National Register of Historical Places which includes the Thomas Fain Plantation. Thomas Fain named his plantation "Arcadia" to which the surrounding community became known. Arcadia is part of the Kingsport–Bristol (TN)–Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the Tri-Cities region. In 1770, the "Treaty of Lochaber" established new boundaries between the Native American lands and the settlers. Settlers then moved into what is now southwestern Virginia and Tennessee. Settlers followed the Great Wagon Road which followed the Great Indian Warpath from Pennsylvania and Maryland through the Great Appalachian Valley into Tennessee. The portion of this path that went through present-day Arcadia was later locally called Reedy Creek Road, Old Kentucky Road, and now Bloomingdale-Pike Road. This portion of the road was also part of Daniel Boone's Wilderness Road which allowed those following the Great Wagon Road to continue past present-day Bristol, through the Reedy Creek Settlement, through Moccasin Gap, and over to Cumberland Gap to settle in Kentucky.
