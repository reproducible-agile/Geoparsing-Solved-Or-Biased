Lota is a city and commune located in the center of Chile on the Gulf of Arauco, in the southern Concepción Province of the Biobío Region, 39 kilometres south of Concepción, and is one of the ten cities(communes) that constitutes the Concepción metropolitan area. The first Spanish settlement, Santa Maria de Guadalupe, was founded by the governor Ángel de Peredo on October 12 1662 but it did not survive long amidst the hostilities of the Arauco War. The modern city expanded with the coal mining industry in the mid-nineteenth century. It was established as a town on January 5, 1875 and became a city on November 30th 1881. The name Lota is thought to be derived from the Mapudungun word Louta meaning small or insignificant settlement. The city's coal mines were nationalized by Salvador Allende due to civil unrest and heavy Socialist support, but privatized again under Augusto Pinochet. The mines were closed in the 1990s after Lota's coal resources were nearly exhausted and cheaper Colombian coal arrived on the market, plunging the residents of Lota into poverty. Today, Lota is one of the poorest cities in Chile and is trying to turn its economy towards tourism. Tourist attractions include guided visits to the coal mine, White Beach, the Park of Lota (created by the Cousiño family), and the Historical Museum of Lota. Lota also has Chile's oldest hydroelectric power station, the Chivilingo Hydroelectric Plant, designed by Thomas Edison and built in 1897.
