Lexington is an unincorporated community in Lexington Township, Scott County, Indiana, United States, located about 10 miles west of the Ohio River and 28 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. The town itself was founded before Indiana became the 19th state in 1816 and was located in Jefferson County at the time it was platted. It was the original county seat from 1820 to 1874, before local leaders decided on a more central location at nearby Scottsburg, which created animosity between the residents of the two towns for several decades afterwards. Lexington is located at 38°39′9.09″N 85°37′34.50″W (38.652525,-85.62625). Lexington was originally settled in 1804 and platted in 1810. It was one of eight towns that were considered for the first state capital of Indiana, with Corydon gaining the honor. It was originally in Jefferson County until 1820, when Scott County was created from parts of Jennings, Jefferson, Clark, Washington and Jackson counties. This area of the state was largely settled by people from the Upper South, traveling by the Ohio River. Since there were no other towns in the county, Lexington was selected as the county seat. After later settlement in northern parts of the county, there were several unsuccessful attempts to relocate the county seat to a more central location. This did not take place until 1874 when residents voted to relocate the county seat to Scottsburg, then spelled "Scottsburgh". Records were removed from the courthouse and transferred at night to avoid a civil war between residents. The relocation of the county seat to Scottsburg created animosity between the two towns for several decades.
