Medina /mᵻˈdaɪnə/ mə-DY-na is a city in Medina County, Ohio, United States. In 2009, CNNMoney named Medina the 40th most desirable American city to live in. The population was 26,678 at the 2010 Census. It is the county seat of Medina County. Medina is located at 41°8′9″N 81°51′51″W (41.135899, -81.864069). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12 square miles (31.08 km2), of which 11.8 square miles (30.56 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) is water. Medina was founded in 1818 as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was originally named Mecca, but an unincorporated community in Ohio already had that name, so the name was changed. Both Mecca and Medina are cities in Saudi Arabia and particularly significant to Islam. Most early residents were farmers. In the 1830s, growth of the community was aided by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which helped transport agricultural products to markets. In 1835, Medina was incorporated as a village and as the county seat of Medina County, Ohio. By 1855, the town's quarries were producing over $200,000 worth of stone per year. In 1857, many of the canal workers started a strike for higher wages; the striking workers were fired, and the four workers who started it were jailed in Albion, Ohio.
