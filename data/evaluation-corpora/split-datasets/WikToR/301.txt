San Agustin (formerly Guintigui-an and Badajoz) is a fourth class municipality in the province of Romblon, Philippines. San Agustin was known during Spanish times as Guintigui-an because of the abundance of a fish called "tigue" in the area. Negrito and Mangyan tribes from Panay and Mindoro were the first inhabitants, as well as migrants from island of Romblon, and southern Tablas. In the early part of Spanish conquest, the first settlement was at barangay Cabolutan. The early settlers found it very trying at times to cross the channel to Romblon town to attend to civil and religious duties. To solve this problem, Cabolutan leaders discussed the matter such as building a visita in their settlement of around 250 souls. Finally in 1635, the first church building made of coral stone and lime was started. In 1700, Spanish authorities decided to separate Cabolutan in Tablas Island from Romblon, with its seat at visita Cabolutan subjugating all settlements west of Tablas Island. The new pueblo or town of Cabolutan progressed slowly and grew more populous despite frequent Moro kidnapping raids. However, in 1790, a smallpox epidemic almost wiped out the town's entire population. The heavy casualty toll caused the puebloâ€™s abolition which led to re- incorporation to Romblon until 1855, when another pueblo named Guintigui-an was founded some 4 kilometers south of the old town site. The town was founded by Don Laureano Montesa together with his brother Don Esteban and cousin Don Luis Montesa, who became Tiniente Absoluto in Romblon. Its jurisdiction included what is now the towns of Calatrava and Santa Maria. The construction of the Cotta (fort) at Payong-Payong hill (located in present-day barangay Cagbo-aya), started in 1873. Cotta protected the community from Muslim pirates and still stands today. In 1868, the town was renamed "Badajoz" by Andres Lebarde, a visiting Spanish soldier, after his native city of Badajoz, Spain.
