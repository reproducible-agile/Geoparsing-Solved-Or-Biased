Wilton is a small village in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland and the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. As the population was less than 100 at the 2011 Census details are kept in the ward of Dormanstown. It is located between Redcar and Eston at the base of Eston Hills â€“ to the east of Eston Nab. The village is noted for its golf course and castle, Wilton Castle. It lies just south of the A174 trunk road. On the other side of the A174, is the village of Lazenby. The parish church is dedicated to St Cuthbert. Wilton Castle was sold to ICI in the 1940s. Wilton Castle is an early 19th-century mansion house, built on the site of a medieval castle, now converted into residential apartments. It is a Grade II listed building. The Bulmer family owned the manor of Wilton in the 13th century and were granted a licence to fortify their manor house in 1210. In 1331 Ralph Bulmer was granted permission to build a castle on his manor. The estate was confiscated by the Crown following the attainder and execution of Sir John and Lady Bulmer for high treason arising out of their part in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536. The manor was restored to their son but was lost again, by sequestration in 1644, following Sir William Bulmers opposition to Parliament during the English Civil War. It was again later restored but the castle had been sleighted by Parliamentary forces and made uninhabitable.
