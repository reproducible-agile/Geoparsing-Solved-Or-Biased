Fala is a settlement on the Drava River in northeastern Slovenia. The part of the settlement on the right bank of the river belongs to the Municipality of Ru≈°e. The part on the left bank of the river belongs to the Municipality of Selnica ob Dravi. Traditionally the area was part of Styria. The municipality is now included in the Drava statistical region. Fala was mentioned in written sources in 1245 as in domo Volmari (and as de Valle in 1279, Vall and Valle in 1289, and Fall in 1495). The name is of unclear origin, although the initial F- indicates a German origin. It could be derived from Old High German falo 'yellowish' (referring to soil or water color) or from valle 'trap' (referring to hunting activity). Derivation from Latin vallis 'valley' is unlikely because the area was not under Romance influence. The Fala hydroelectric power plant in the settlement was built between 1913 and 1918. As a technological and construction achievement of its time, the Slovenian Ministry of Culture included it in its register of monuments of national importance in 2008.
