Guayabal is a municipality (municipio) of the Azua province in the Dominican Republic. The people speak with a heavy "Sureño" accent, meaning Southern, typical of Southern Dominicans. That is, an „o“ sounds almost like an „u“. So you hear Riu or Tiu (uncle) instead of Rio or Tio. Guayabal lies 725 meters above sea level at the confluence of the Arroyo Guayabal in the Rio Cueva. The coordinates are 18°44'56 N 70°50'11 W (from Google Earth). A trail goes through the Arroyo Guayabal to Constanza. Constanza is about a two-hour drive, yet the roads require the use of sports utility vehicles. Guayabal is about 20 km (50 minutes if using the public minibus, Guagua) north-east of Padre las Casas, and about another 2 hours, in the Guagua, away from the province capital Azua de Compostela. Guayabal administrates some smaller villages alongside the Rio Cueva. These villages are accessible solely with offroad capable vehicles. Some include: Periquito (20 min. west), Arroyo Corozo (15 min. east), La Guama (30 min. south-east) and El Recodo (2 hr.'s south-east). Being that Guayabal is difficult to access its residents are very dependent on Padre las Casas for many goods and services.
