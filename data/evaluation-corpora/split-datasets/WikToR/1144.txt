An asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain which operated from 1936 to 1993 left an estimated 3,500,000 cubic yards (2,700,000 m3) of mill tailings. In 2008, the state warned residents of Eden and nearby towns that there was a "health risk" for people living within a 10 miles (16 km) radius of the mine. Aboveground mill tailings were estimated at 16,000,000 cubic yards (12,000,000 m3). In April 2009, the Vermont Department of Health released a revised study which found that all of the deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by occupational exposure. The report also concluded that people living near the mines had no increased risk of asbestos-related illness vis-a-vis people living anywhere else in Vermont.
