Urdaneta (Pangasinan: Ciudad na Urdaneta; Ilocano: Ciudad ti Urdaneta) is a second class city in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 125,451 people, with a land area of 12,100 hectares. Gateway to Northern Philippines, the city's strategic location is on the central part of eastern Pangasinan. The first settlers of the area were Pangasinenses, followed by a migration of Ilocanos who settled in outlying areas. These settlers petitioned the Spanish government to allow them to form a separate pueblo for greater ties and stronger unity. Their petition was granted and Urdaneta was formally founded as a pueblo on January 8, 1858. There is uncertainty if it was named after Andr√©s de Urdaneta, Miguel de Urdaneta, or Simon de Urdaneta. Urdaneta became a city through Republic Act 8480, otherwise known as "An Act Converting the Municipality of Urdaneta, Province of Pangasinan into a Component City to be known as the City of Urdaneta". This was signed on January 10, 1998 and was voted affirmatively by the people of Urdaneta City on March 21, 1998.
