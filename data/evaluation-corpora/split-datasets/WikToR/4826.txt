Churchill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Gallatin County, Montana, United States. The population was 902 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Bozeman, MT Micropolitan Statistical Area. It was formerly part of the Amsterdam-Churchill CDP. Churchill is located at 45°45′00″N 111°18′37″W (45.749951, -111.310256). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.6 square miles (9.3 km2), all of it land. Church Hill, or Churchill as it was later shortened by Gallatin County Road Department, is located a few miles away from Amsterdam on a locally prominent hill. Churchill is the site of the Dutch community's church- the 1st Christian Reformed Church, today known as Manhattan Christian Reformed Church; and related parent-operated private P-12 school, Manhattan Christian School. The large church on the hill is the probable origin of the name. Not to be outdone, The Milwaukee Road Railway designated the other side of "the hill" as Holland, and made a siding for agricultural goods on its railway about two miles to the east, and designated it as the Holland Siding.
