Dora (Arabic: الدورة‎) is a suburb north-east of Beirut in the Matn District of Mount Lebanon Governorate. The suburb has commercial and residential zones. Dora is administered by Bourj Hammoud municipality. Dora is a mainly Christian suburb of Beirut but Lebanese of other faiths also call the suburb home. Foreign laborers, especially Egyptians, Iraqis and Sri Lankans also live in Dora due to the lower-cost rents available.

The Dora Commercial Centre is a mixed-use commercial establishment and one of Lebanon's largest malls, City Mall, which formerly housed a branch of Giant, a European hypermarket chain based in France, now called TSC Mega. The center also hosts Cinema City, a nine-screen multiplex of 1,789 seats arranged around a central sky-lit atrium. There are numerous churches in Dora, including the Church of Saint Joseph and the Christian Endeavor Young Adults Association of the Armenian Evangelical Emmanuel Church.
