Ada (/ˈeɪdə/ AY-də) is a city in Norman County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,707 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat. Minnesota State Highways 9 and 200 are two of the main routes in the city. Ada was laid out in 1874. The town was named for the eldest daughter of William H. Fisher, attorney and superintendent of the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad, who had died aged 6. A post office has been in operation at Ada since 1876. Ada was incorporated in 1881. Ada and neighboring community Borup (located approximately 8 miles south of Ada on Minnesota State Highway 9) are served by the Ada-Borup Schools. Both the elementary and high schools are located in Ada, following the closing of the Borup site in 2010. The elementary building serves PreK-6 students and was built in 1978; the adjacent high school houses students in grades 7-12 and was constructed in 1998 following the devastating 1997 Red River Flood, which destroyed the former 1953 building on Ada's east side. The district covers over 345 square miles and serves approximately 530 students.
