Duncan is a village in Platte County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 351 at the 2010 census. The transcontinental railroad reached the site of Duncan in 1866. Among the first settlers in the area were Polish and Swiss immigrants. In June 1869, the post office of Cherry Hill was established on the site. In October 1871, the townsite of Jackson was laid out by officials of the Union Pacific Railroad. Jackson was chosen in 1879 as the southern terminus of the Omaha, Niobrara, and Black Hills Railroad, a Union Pacific subsidiary, purportedly because Jay Gould was angry at Columbus for promoting a rival railroad in the region. In 1880, the settlement's name was changed to Duncan, owing to the existence of another Jackson in Dakota County. The new name honored General Wood B. Duncan, a prominent onetime local resident. In the following year, an ice jam destroyed the Omaha, Niobrara, and Black Hills Railroad bridge across the Loup River; the line was later moved to branch off the main line of the Union Pacific at Columbus.
