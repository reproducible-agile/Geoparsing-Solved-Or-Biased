Arnold is a market town, unparished area and suburb of the city of Nottingham, in the English ceremonial county of Nottinghamshire. It is to the north-east of Nottingham’s city boundary, and is in the local government district of Gedling Borough. Since 1968 Arnold has had a market, and the town used to have numerous factories associated with the hosiery industry. Arnold’s town centre is the largest in Gedling Borough (whose headquarters are located in the town) and the most important in the northeastern part of the Greater Nottingham conurbation. At the time of the 2011 Census, Arnold had a population of 37,768. Areas within Arnold include Daybrook, Woodthorpe, Redhill and Killisick. Arnold was referred to as ‘Ernehale’ in the Domesday Book of 1068; this former name meant ‘place frequented by eagles’ or ‘the valley of eagles’. ‘A History of Arnold’ (1913) by Rev. Rupert W. King and Rev. James Russell explains the etymology of Arnold’s name thus: ‘Heron-hald’, meaning the corner of the forest where Herons (large birds) live. Which becomes over the centuries since 500 A.D. by ‘lazy’ pronunciation, Eron-ald, thence Ern-old and Arn-old.
