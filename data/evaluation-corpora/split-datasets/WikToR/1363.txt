Concord is a suburban industrial neighbourhood in the City of Vaughan in York Region, located north of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. According to the 2001 Census, the neighbourhood has 8,255 residents (including the community of Carrville). It is accessed by two provincial highways: Highway 407 and Highway 400. Concord is bordered by Steeles Avenue to the south, Black Creek to the west (roughly Highway 400), the Upper West Don River to the east (roughly Dufferin Street) and Rutherford Road to the north. Prior to the 1950s, when Highway 400 was first opened, Concord was an agricultural community, covered mostly by farmlands. Housing developments also began in the 1950s, east of Keele Street, as well as construction of a CN railway by-pass of Toronto with a 4 km freight yard. This decade also saw an industrial park added near Jane Street. In the 1970s, the industrialization of the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area began. The area east of Keele consists of industrialized buildings and a plaza on Highway 7, with industrial buildup continuing into the 1980s. A residential area, Glen Shields, was built in the 1970s and 1980s in the southeast, west of Dufferin. 1992 also saw the commencement of the construction of Highway 407, which opened in 1997, with three Concord interchanges. Another residential section, Dufferin Hill, was built in the 2000s in the northeast, near Dufferin and Rutherford. In the early 2000s, construction of the Vaughan Mills shopping mall began, being completed in 2004.
