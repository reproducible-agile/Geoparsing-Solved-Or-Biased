Sopo is a civil parish in the municipality of Vila Nova de Cerveira in the Portuguese northern district of Viana do Castelo. The population in 2011 was 557, in an area of 14.82 kmÂ². References from 1258 identify the existence of several churches situated between the Lima and Minho Rivers, and that one of these churches, named Zopo, belonged to the Bishop of Tui. By the beginning of the 16th century, the parish of Sopo was part of the Archdiocese of Braga and belonged to the municipality of Caminha; comparably, Sopo was part of this municipality by 1546. A 1580 census completed by friar Baltasar Limpo, in order to determine the condition of the deaconship, referred to the parish of Santiago de Sopo within the comarca of Caminha, an area that was divided between the clergy of the archbishop and other lay clergy. Archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa confirmed a donation to Sopo, completed by several people to the Marquis of Vila Real. The Marquis, later, transferred the patronage of Sopo to his son, the Duke of Caminha, who was, along with his father, implicated in the conspiracy against John IV.
