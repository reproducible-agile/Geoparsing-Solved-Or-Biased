Dale, South Carolina, is an unincorporated community located in northern Beaufort County in the southern corner of the state of South Carolina, U.S.A. It is located approximately five miles north of Beaufort, South Carolina on U.S. Route 21, designated the Trask Parkway in that area. The zip code for Dale, South Carolina, is 29914. Dale was formerly on the alignment of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad's Carolina Division low-level main line, constructed from 1915 and opened December 31, 1917. This rail route passed to the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad with the July 1, 1967 merger of the SAL and longtime rival Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, becoming the Charleston Subdivision, and the line downgraded with most traffic rerouting over the former ACL alignment to the west. The "East Carolina Subdivision", as it was colloquially called, was abandoned by stages, with the first portion removed north of Dale, between Lobeco and Charleston, after October 1, 1967. Following the April 21, 1971 destruction of the old SAL lift bridge over the Savannah River by a ship in foggy conditions, the southern connection into Savannah was cut and the rail line removed between Coosaw and Pritchardville, south of Dale, in 1978. Most of the remaining line was lifted in 1982. Portions of the alignment have been converted into the New River Linear Trail hiking trail.
