Victoria, also known as Rabat or by its title Città Victoria, is the capital city of Gozo, the second largest island in Malta. The city has a total population of 6,901 (March 2014), and by population is the largest locality in Gozo. The area around the town, situated on a hill near the centre of the island, has been settled since Neolithic times. Victoria is the name given 10 June 1887 by the British government on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, at the request of the Bishop of Malta, Mons. Sir Pietro Pace. However many Gozitans still often refer to it by the name Rabat. It is usually known as Ir-Rabat Għawdex to distinguish it from the town of Rabat on the main island of Malta. In the heart of Victoria lies the Cittadella (Citadel), formerly known as il Castello, which has been the centre of activity of the island since possibly Neolithic times, but is known to be first fortified during the Bronze Age c. 1500 BC. It was later developed by the Phoenicians and continued into becoming a complex Acropolis by Roman times.
