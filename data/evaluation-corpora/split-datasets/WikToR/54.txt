Aurora (2011 population 53,203) is an affluent town in York Region in the Greater Toronto Area, within the Golden Horseshoe of Southern Ontario. It is located north of the town of Richmond Hill and is partially situated on the Oak Ridges Moraine. In the Canada 2011 Census, the municipal population of Aurora was the 95th largest in Canada, compared to 97th for the 2006 Census. Many Aurora residents commute to Toronto and surrounding communities. Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe gave the order for Yonge Street to be extended to Holland Landing in 1793, and the way was paved for the establishment of a community where Aurora now stands. In 1795, the first house in Aurora was built at Yonge St and Catherine Av. In 1804, Richard Machell became the first merchant at the cross roads of Yonge and Wellington and the hamlet soon became known as Machell's Corners. Charles Doan was another early businessman at Machell's Corners and became the first postmaster and later the first reeve. As postmaster, he was influential in renaming the village Aurora. With the coming of the railway in 1853, Aurora emerged as an important centre north of Toronto. The Fleury plough works was established soon after and Aurora was on its way to becoming a flourishing industrial town.
