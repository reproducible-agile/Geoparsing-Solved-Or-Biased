Whitney (formerly East Las Vegas) is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in Clark County, Nevada, United States. The population was 38,585 at the 2010 census. Whitney, at one time, had its own identity, one of a few small communities between Las Vegas and Henderson along Boulder Highway (which was US 93 and US 95 at the time). Whitney Elementary School was a converted Barracks. It housed grades from first to seventh until the 1960s, then the seventh graders were moved to Henderson Junior High. In the beginning years the town boasted a Post Office operated by John and Nellie Bunch, owners of much of the Whitney property and surrounding areas. The town consisted of three streets running east and west: Whitney Avenue, Keenan Avenue, and Missouri Avenue. Cross streets running north and south were 1st Street, 2nd Street, and 3rd Street. Among recognized businesses were Harry Gunn's Liquor Store, The Three Pigs Bar, Louise's Bar, The Exotica bar (with Sarah at the piano), the Wind N Sand Cafe, a gas station/market, a motel and a couple of trailer parks. High School students attended Basic High in Henderson. Even when phone service reached our little town, it was still long distance charges to Henderson. Still a segregated society, there were a couple of off-the-grid settements of black families who lived by Duck Creek at the outskirts of town.
