Together with Camogli, Pieve Ligure, Bogliasco and Recco, it is part of the so-called Golfo Paradiso in the Riviera di Levante. Economy is based on tourism and production of olives. The municipality of Sori contains the frazioni (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) Canepa, Capreno, Lago, Levà, Polanesi, San Bartolomeo di Busonengo, Sant’Apollinare, Sussisa, and Teriasca. Sori borders the following municipalities: Avegno, Bargagli, Bogliasco, Genoa, Lumarzo, Pieve Ligure, Recco, Uscio. According to some theories, Sori was founded by Greek emigrants around the 7th century BC. Most likely, the small port was also used by the Romans, although the first mention of the town dates to the early Middle Ages, when it was a possession of the bishops of Milan; later it was part of the Republic of Genoa. In 1548 the town was sacked and ravagaed by 1500 pirates from North Africa. After the French domination, in 1815 Sori became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and from 1861 of the unified Kingdom of Italy.
