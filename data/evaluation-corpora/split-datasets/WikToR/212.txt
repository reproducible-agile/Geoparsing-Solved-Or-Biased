Boston is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 8,023 at the 2010 census. The town is named after Boston, Massachusetts. Boston is an interior town of the county and one of the county's "Southtowns". Boston is south of Buffalo. The Iroquois, under various names, lived here until the European immigrants became predominant. In 1804, brothers Charles and Oliver Johnson and their families became the area's first settlers. The first Christian church was the Free Will Baptist Church, founded circa 1811. On April 5, 1817, the town of Boston was formed from a portion of the town of Eden. The first post office opened in 1832 on the north side of town. In 1843, the town suffered an epidemic (28 of the 43 residents were affected, 10 of them died) believed to be typhoid fever, possibly from a local well. This town has much history that can be found on the headstones in the cemetery across from the Boston Town Hall. There are many old gravestones that show some of the first settlers in the town and the infamous "Love" murder.
