Elizabeth is a statutory town which is the most populous municipality in Elbert County, Colorado, United States. The population was 1,358 at the 2010 census, down from 1,434 at the 2000 census. According to records of the area, the first settler was a man named Peter I. Van Wormer in 1859 on Running Creek, which today runs through Elizabeth. Following him on his journey was pioneer and trapper Justin Marlow. Aside from Marlow, others followed establishing small ranches in the area that was then forested with ponderosa pines in an open glade-like habitat suitable for both ranching and timber operations. The Elbert County History is not clear on when exactly the mill that eventually caused the formation of the town of Elizabeth was set up. It was apparently on the far north end of the land belonging to Thomas Phillips (who settled in the area in 1865) and to the east of the creek to provide water to the steam engine. This first mill was wiped out in a flood and thereafter was reestablished by Alden Bassatt on the west side of the creek near what is today Main Street in Elizabeth. Thereafter it was sold to the Weber brothers of Kansas and became known as the Weber Mill. P.P. Gomer set up another mill operation in 1860 or 1861 to the north of the Weber operation on Leroy Evans' Ranch.
