Barreiros is a municipality in the Spanish province of Lugo. This municipality is closely linked to the history of the province from pre-Roman times. It has a geographical range extending from the valleys to the mountains and from the plains to the coast with high cliffs and long beaches. The first name mentioned is that of Cabarcos, which seems to come from Civarcos. The town was named for Plinio and situated between the mouths of Eo and Masma.

It corresponds to a donation of land of King Don Silo to monks so that they could build a monastery. Around 1400 Pardo de Cela held the preserve forum of Santa Cristina de Celeiro. In 1406 Lopez Diaz donated the Terrería de Cabarcos to donated to the Bishop of Mondoñedo.
