Stanton is village situated in north Suffolk, about nine miles north-east of Bury St. Edmunds, on the A143 road to Diss. Close to the village lies the former WW II airfield RAF Shepherds Grove, where American forces were based. One of the main landmarks in the village is the fine restored windmill at Upthorpe Farm, to the east of the village. The name " Stanton" means 'a homestead on stony ground'. It's believed the site of the village has been continuously occupied since Roman times Stanton dates back to Roman times, sited at the junction of Peddars Way and the Roman road believed to run between Camulodunum (Colchester) and Bildeston. The site of a Roman Villa known as 'Stanton Chare' is at the junction of the two ancient routes. The Manor of Stanton was held for many years by Abbots of Bury St Edmunds, and subsequently by the Capel-Lofft family. The present parish was formed from two earlier parishes, Stanton All Saints and Stanton St John. The former St John's Church, on a prominent hill outside the village, was abandoned and services continued at All Saints in the village centre.
