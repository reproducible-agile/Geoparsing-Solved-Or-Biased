The railroad established the towns of Reading and Wilmont in 1899. When the railroad reached present-day Lismore at 3:00 pm on Saturday, June 9, 1900, construction of the town immediately commenced. The first business on site was the St. Croix Lumber company which sold its wares from a tent pitched next to a large pile of lumber hauled in from Wilmont. The first building in town was built by James Beacom and was used as a saloon. The second building in town was the O. B. Bratager store building. James Montgomery started a small grain elevator, and James Ramage opened a lumber yard and hardware store under the management of Arch Priest. The Bank of Lismore opened its doors on September 1, 1900, and was incorporated as the State Bank of Lismore three months later. A livery stable, a butcher shop, a restaurant, and a blacksmith shop were also opened in that first year. A school house, churches, several businesses, and many residences were constructed in 1901.
