Woodville is a town in and the county seat of Wilkinson County, Mississippi. The population was 1,096 at the 2010 census. The Woodville Republican, a weekly newspaper founded in 1823, is the oldest surviving business (and thus the oldest newspaper) in Mississippi. This historic town, one of the oldest European-American towns in Mississippi, is set among the rolling hills and pastures of Wilkinson County, just north of the Louisiana-Mississippi border in the southwest corner of the state. It was incorporated in 1811, after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and not long before Mississippi’s admission to the United States in 1817. It was developed along the historic corridor between St. Francisville, Louisiana, 24 miles to the south and Natchez, Mississippi, 34 miles to the north. Since pre-colonial times, communities within this corridor have been linked, first by the Lower Natchez Trace, a footpath and portage developed by Native Americans and serving the east bank of the Mississippi River. In the 20th century, U. S. Highway 61, the “Blues Highway,” was later built along this route; it is considered the spine of jazz and blues, America’s music.
