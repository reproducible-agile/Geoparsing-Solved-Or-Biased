Brighton is the northernmost suburb of Brisbane City, Australia, located 19 kilometres (12 mi) north of the Brisbane CBD. The Nashville locality makes up much of the southwest of the suburb. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb had a population of 9,012. Brighton features mostly suburban housing. The large nursing home Eventide, run by the Queensland Government, is within Brighton. Brighton was also home to the World War II barracks of the RAAF Air Training School between December 1940 to May 1946 and was built on reclaimed land. After this time it became The Eventide Nursing Home. More than 700 patients were transferred from Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island to the facility. It was announced in late 2012 that the nursing home will close because ensuring the aging buildings complied with building codes was uneconomic. In the 2011 census, Brighton recorded a population of 9,012 people, 51.1% female and 48.9% male. The median age of the Brighton population was 40 years of age, 3 years above the Australian median. 78.4% of people living in Brighton were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 5.3%, New Zealand 4.3%, Scotland 0.8%, Philippines 0.6%, Ireland 0.5%.
