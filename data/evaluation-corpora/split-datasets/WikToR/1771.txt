Belovo (Russian: Белово) is a town in Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, located on the Bachat River 170 kilometers (110 mi) south of Kemerovo. Population: 76,764 (2010 Census); 82,425 (2002 Census); 93,108 (1989 Census). The village of Belovo for the first time is mentioned in 1726. It was named after a fugitive peasant Fyodor Belov, who built a small taiga house, a so-called zaimka, on the bank of the Bachat River. The year of 1855 was a new page in the history of settlement: the mining of mineral resources on the found coal field began. In 1938, Belovo was granted town status. The town developed as a conglomeration of departmental settlements, whose population was directly or indirectly involved with the coal mines, a power station, and the railway. Within the framework of administrative divisions, Belovo serves as the administrative center of Belovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with four urban-type settlements (Bachatsky, Gramoteino, Inskoy, and Novy Gorodok) and two rural localities, incorporated separately as Belovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Belovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Belovsky Urban Okrug.
