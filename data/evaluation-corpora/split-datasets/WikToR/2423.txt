The name (pronounced just like English cake) comes from the Tlingit word Ḵéix̱' (Northern Tlingit) or Ḵéex̱' (Southern Tlingit), which is derived from ḵée “dawn, daylight” and x̱ʼé “mouth”, i.e. “mouth of dawn” or “opening of daylight”. Kake is located at 56°58′15″N 133°56′2″W (56.970841, -133.933751). Kake is on the northwest coast of Kupreanof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska.
