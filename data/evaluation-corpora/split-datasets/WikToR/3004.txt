Beaufort (Lios an Ph√∫ca in Gaelic) is a small village that lies on the banks of the River Laune in County Kerry, South West of Ireland, consisting of a post office, three public houses, one supermarket, parish hall, guest houses and thirty private houses with a population of about 160. Beaufort sits at the foot of Ireland's highest mountain Carrantuohill at 1,038 metres. In 1911, Kalem Compagny, an American moving picture company settled several weeks to shoot films. Among the company: the director Sidney Olcott, actress Gene Gauntier, Alice Hollister and actors Jack J. Clark, Robert Vignola, JP McGowan, the cinematographer George K. Hollister. The first film was Rory O'More. Followed by The Colleen Bawn and Arrah-na-Pogue adapted from Dion Boucicault's plays. Olcott came back each summer until 1914. He rent the hotel owned by Patrick O'Sullivan who has the pub too which still exits today: The Beaufort Bar. Over 100 historical sites have been identified and mapped in the area including the Ogham Stones, two castle ruins, and Dunloe Castle, built in 1207. The ruins of two ancient churches still stand in the parish today. One, situated in Kilgobnet in O'Sheas Land and associated with St. Gobnait, the other in Churchtown burial ground, which is more than five centuries old.
