Wayne County is a county located in the Ozark foothills in the U.S. state of Missouri. As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,521. The county seat is Greenville. The county was officially organized on December 11, 1818, and is named after General "Mad" Anthony Wayne who served in the American Revolutionary War. Wayne County was created in December 1818 by the last Missouri Territorial Legislature out of parts of Cape Girardeau and Lawrence counties and thus predates the state of Missouri being admitted to the Union. In March 1819, Congress established the Territory of Arkansas and most of Lawrence County, Missouri Territory became Lawrence County, Arkansas Territory. The small strip of “Old Lawrence County” that had been orphaned in Missouri was added to Wayne County by the Missouri State Constitution of 1820. The Osage Strip along the Kansas border was added in 1825. From 1825-1831, Wayne County was an enormous area larger than Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware combined. All or part of 32 counties in Missouri were at one point part of Wayne County. When Wayne County was formed, five commissioners were appointed to govern the county. They chose a small settlement known locally as Cedar Cabin located on the St. Francis River to be the county seat and named it Greenville. In 1900, Greenville had a population of about 1,000. By 1940, the population had declined to 572. The town was relocated by the construction of Lake Wappapello in 1941 and the new town only had a population of 270 in 1950. Today, approximately 450 people call Greenville home.
