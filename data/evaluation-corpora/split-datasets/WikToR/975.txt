Salina is an island in the Aeolian Islands (Italian: Isole Eolie, Sicilian: ÃŒsuli Eoli) north of Sicily, southern Italy. It is the second largest island in the archipelago. Salina is divided between three comuni: Santa Marina on the eastern coast, Malfa to the north, and Leni to the south-west. From Leni down towards the sea is the village of Rinella, Sicily. Above the village of Leni is Valdichiesa in the center of the island. The other smaller villages are Capo Faro, Pollara and Lingua. There are currently approximately 4,000 residents living on the island. Salina has a total surface area of 27 km2 (10 sq mi). It is included on the World Heritage List especially because of its worth for vulcanology. It is composed of six volcanoes: the oldest ones are at Pizzo di Corvo, Monte Rivi and close to Capo Faro, although these are barely recognisable from a morphological point of view, while the volcano-layer of Monte Fossa delle Felci at 968 m (3,176 ft) is the highest peak in the archipelago and Monte dei Porri 886 m (2,907 ft) are both almost perfectly preserved. A lower crater lies just above sea level near the small village of Pollara,on the north west corner of the island, half of which has fallen into the sea.
