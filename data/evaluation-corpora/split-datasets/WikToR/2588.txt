Buda is a historical neighbourhood in the Belgian city of Courtray. The neighbourhood is part of the historical old town. Since it lies between two branches of the River Leie, it is an island and is also called the 'Buda-island'. Buda has been known as the area north of the River Leie for centuries. From 1454 onwards, Buda was incorporated within the city boundaries thanks to new ramparts. This stone wall around the city was 2.3 km long. The name Buda rose for the first time at the end of the 17th century. In 1686, the city of Buda in Hungary was conquered from the Turks. Compared to Pest, the upper town of Buda lies on the other side of the Donau River. When Vauban in 1690 and 1698 developed the new fortifications around the Buda Island in Courtray, people said they had built a little Buda over here, near the existing Broel Towers. This name was kept alive among the inhabitants of the city and was found for the first times in the city archives in 1734. Later on, this name was given to the main street along the island. This Buda street (Budastraat in Dutch) is one of the eldest streets in town.
