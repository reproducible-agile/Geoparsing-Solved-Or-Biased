The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Gujrat District. During the period of British rule, Gujrat District increased in population and importance. The actual name of that town was Deen Gha (hub of Islamic education) but with the interval of time during the British empire its name became Dinga.
