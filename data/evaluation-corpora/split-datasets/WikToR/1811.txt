Littleton is a village in the borough of Spelthorne, Surrey, England. Its amenities are a Church of England parish church, village green and Shepperton Studios. It covers a narrow east-west strip of land between the centre of Shepperton Green to the southeast and the Queen Mary Reservoir to its north, having contributed most of the land to the reservoir in 1931 and having historically reached to the River Thames at Chertsey Bridge. Contiguous with Shepperton Green which has a parade of shops, the divide is the River Ash, a stream. It borders Laleham to the west and Charlton which is also in the post town of Shepperton, centred 0.5 miles (800 m) to the north-east and which has one of the nearest pubs. London Heathrow Airport is centred 5 miles (8 km) north. The River Thames is 2.5 miles (4 km) south. Sunbury Golf Course is beyond the M3 motorway past a very narrow strip of Charlton, all of which once lay within Sunbury. That land and Upper Halliford is however since the early 20th century also within Shepperton's postal boundaries.
