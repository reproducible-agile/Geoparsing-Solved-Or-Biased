Gloria (formerly Maligaya) is a third-class municipality in the province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 42,012 people. The town was previously a barangay called Maligaya, the largest barangay during the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal. Local politicians, led by former guerrilla chief Nicolas Jamilla, Sr., battled for the conversion of Maligaya into a new town. They renamed it after the ten-year-old daughter of the President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who later on herself became the fourteenth President in 2001. Jamilla became the first mayor of the town, which kept the old name "Maligaya" as the name of a barangay in the poblacion. Gloria is divided into 27 barangays: nine (9) barangays are situated along the national highway; six (6) are coastal barangays; and twelve (12) interior barangays on the west side. Gloria was once part of the municipality of Pinamalayan. In 1915, migrant families from Marinduque settled in Barrio Tambong, and in 1930, when a national road was built through Pinamalayan, they moved west and occupied the area along this road. Tambong was later divided into two barrios: the first retained the original name, while the second was called Maligaya (meaning "happy"), alluding to the settlers' happiness at the bountiful yield of their agricultural crops.
