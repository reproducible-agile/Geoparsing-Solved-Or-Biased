It is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 266 at the 2010 census. Harrisburg was named for John W. Harris, who inherited the Model Farm on what was Thrall's Prairie, the first permanent settlement in the county. The town was laid out on the survey line of the prospective Chicago and Alton railroad. The line was graded and prepared, but was abandoned for a line farther north. The proposed line can be seen on the 1969 USGS topographic map of Harrisburg. According to Colonel W. F. Switzler, in 1882, there were a post office, three stores, a confectionary shop, a church, a mill, a blacksmith shop, and the historic school building with the Masonic lodge above. The post office was located in the saddle shop. Reverend Green Carey preached at the Bethlehem Baptist church a few miles south of Harrisburg for fifty years and claimed to have joined more than five hundred couples in marriage.
