Arlington is a former town in western Phelps County, Missouri, United States, along a county road that was once U.S. Route 66. The town found its prosperity in the mid-19th century. Located near Rolla on the Ozark Plateau, the only remaining business at Arlington was a caravan park that closed permanently in 2008. Arlington was originally called Little Piney. It was manned at times by troops form the 5th Missouri State Militia Cavalry. Originally settled by Thomas Harrison and James Harrison and later established as a township by General Fremont circa-1867, the town was renamed for the former Robert E. Lee plantation (later a cemetery) at Arlington, Virginia, Arlington was once a popular resort served by the Pacific Railroad. Located on the last section of U.S. Route 66 in Missouri to be paved in 1931, the tiny community served fishermen on the Gasconade and Little Piney Rivers. Stony Dell Resort capitalised on U.S. Route 66 and the nearby Fort Leonard Wood military base to grow in the 1930s and early 1940s from a small group of tourist cabins to a popular oasis which included a stream-fed swimming pool, a restaurant, service station and bus stop, offering tennis, dancing, boating and fishing.
