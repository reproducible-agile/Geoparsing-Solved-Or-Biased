It finally gained its independence during the arrival of the Americans on February 11, 1900. This taste of freedom was, however, momentary for after the establishment of the Civil Government occurred in the Philippines in the year 1903, Bombon was ceded to the municipality of Calabanga . The municipality of Bombon also became a barrio of Magarao, now another town in the second district. For more than forty years of waiting, it was finally given its proclamation as a town by virtue of Executive Order (EO) 251 dated July 27, 1949 signed by the former President Elpidio Quirino.The mayor at the time was Jose Buenagua Sr, whose son Jose Buenagua Jr went on to be the Provincial Engineer of Albay. Jose Jr now resides in Scottsdale AZ. He had also two daughters, Irene Buenagua Fernandez and Lydia Buenagua Guerrero, both retired teachers, and three other sons, Salvador, Melchor, and Diogenes Buenagua who are all still residing in Bombon. The acquired independence continued permanently and it served well its constituents.
