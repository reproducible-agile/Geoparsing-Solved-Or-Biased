Keller is an unincorporated community in southeastern Ferry County in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Washington. The town is located in the San Poil Valley, and was founded in 1898 by John C. Keller, a local businessman. The town was located in the area now known as the San Poil Bay (or Old Keller to the locals); at its height the town had an estimated population of 3,500 and even featured a minor league baseball team and red light district. The town was moved several times beginning in 1941 due to back watering from the Grand Coulee Dam which flooded its previous locations and is now located eighteen miles north of the Columbia River which seriously reduced its population over time. The population at the 2010 census was 234. The town is encompassed by the Colville Indian Reservation, which has an estimated population of roughly 1,200 people mostly of Native American descent and primarily members of the Sanpoil Tribe of Indians, one of the Twelve Tribes that make up the Colville Confederated Tribes and one of the few Indian Nations that was never relocated by order of the U.S. Government.
