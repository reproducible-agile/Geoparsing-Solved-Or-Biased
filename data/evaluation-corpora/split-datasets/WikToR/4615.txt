Greenmount is a village in the district of Tottington amongst the West Pennine Moors, within the northern area of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, in Greater Manchester, England. Historically a part of Lancashire, Greenmount is 13 miles (21 km) north of Manchester, 1 mile (2 km) to the northeast of Tottington, and 2 miles (3 km) to the south of Ramsbottom. The village of Greenmount now has its own community web page. The name Greenmount came into existence in 1848 when the Sunday School was built. It was originally spelt Green Mount. Some residents of the older generation, who were born in Greenmount, still write it as two separate words. Greenmount was, in 1848, part of the outskirts of the village of Tottington. At first, people who lived near to the Sunday School included the name of Greenmount in their address and gradually this was extended to the surrounding area and so Greenmount became a village. The only boundaries which can be traced are the ward boundaries, which came into existence after the Local Government Act of 1894. These were changed in 1979. [C B Taylor, A History of Greenmount].
