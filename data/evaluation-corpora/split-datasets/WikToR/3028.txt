Stanton is an unincorporated community located within Readington Township in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. The community dates back to the 17th century and was settled by the Dutch. It was originally called Housel's after Johannes Housel, who had a farmstead along Dreahook Road in the mid-18th century. After the death of William Housel (who started a school in the community), the last owner of the Housel farmstead, it then carried the name of Waggoner's Hill after landowner William Waggoner. The community took the descriptive name of Mount Pleasant during the beginning of the 20th century and would finally become known as Stanton to distinguish it from another Mount Pleasant. The name "Stanton" was taken from James Logan's Pennsylvania estate: Stenton, which in turn is named for the Scottish village where his father was born. Logan was a proprietor of West Jersey, a mayor of Philadelphia, and a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Logan Way in Readington is named after him, as well as Logan Circle and the Logan neighborhood in Philadelphia and Logan Township in Clinton County, Pennsylvania. In the 1830s, a Reformed Church and a general store were built, both of which are present today.
