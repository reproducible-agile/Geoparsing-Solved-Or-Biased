Taylor is a town in Navajo County, Arizona, United States. It was founded by Mormon settlers (James Pearce) in January 1878, several months before the neighboring community of Snowflake, Arizona. Taylor straddles Silver Creek, flowing from the nearby White Mountains to the Little Colorado River on Arizona's Colorado Plateau. According to the 2010 census, the population of the town is 4,112. There is no postal home delivery in Taylor. Residents within a certain radius of the Post Office who produce proof of Taylor residency are allocated a small PO box free of charge. Residents of Snowflake have postal delivery. Lack of postal delivery is also a problem when using services that validate postal addresses, as none will validate in Taylor. Taylor was once served by the Apache Railway. The tracks were constructed between 1917–1920 and extended from the Santa Fe Railway at Holbrook, Arizona to Snowflake and then via Taylor to the forests at McNary. The Snowflake to McNary line was abandoned in 1984. Taylor is located at 34°27′57″N 110°6′16″W (34.465762, -110.104385). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 24.6 square miles (64 km2), all of it land.
