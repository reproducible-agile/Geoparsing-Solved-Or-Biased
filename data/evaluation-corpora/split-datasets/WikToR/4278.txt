Mapua is a small town in the South Island of New Zealand. It is to the west of Nelson on State Highway 60 and on the coastline of Tasman Bay. The 2006 census gave a population of 1878, up 16.1 percent since the 2001 Census.: With a thriving wharf and commercial area, Mapua has grown in popularity for visitors, with numbers swelling the region over the summer months. A large fair and market is held every Easter Sunday. Up to 30,000 people visit the town on this day to enjoy rides, stalls, and other attractions. The local schools and playcentre benefit from the fair, which is their primary fundraising activity. Middens, tools and human bones found at Grossis Point and around the Northern edges of the Waimea inlet suggest small seasonal Maori settlements were located here With a Major Pa (fortified settlement) located on the Kina Cliffs, Which survived through to early European settlement of the Mapua area, and can still be visited by the public. The lack of evidence of cannibalism and the rarity of weapons indicates that the Maori living in this district were peaceful and seldom were involved in wars. In the late 1820s, Maori from the North Island (led by the Maori Chief Te Rauparaha) came to the South Island with warriors armed with muskets. Te Rauparaha took over Marlborough before sending half his army west to take over Tasman Bay and Golden Bay. Due to the invaders' considerable advantage in weaponry and skill, they soon overcame the local Maori populations. After a battle, most of the invaders moved on, leaving only a small local population of Maori left in the region.
