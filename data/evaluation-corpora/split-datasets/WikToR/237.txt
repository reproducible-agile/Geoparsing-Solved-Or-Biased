Hamilton is an abandoned mining town located in the White Pine Range, in western White Pine County, Nevada, United States. Hamilton rapidly came into being after discovery of rich silver ore in the area. The first settlers found shelter in local caves, which were numerous. By May 1868, the settlement, then known as "Cave City" was formed. The town boomed following the discovery of rich silver deposits nearby. By that winter, it had approximately 600 inhabitants. It was soon renamed for mine promoter W.H. Hamilton. The post office first opened for business on August 10, 1868 while the community was still part of Lander County, Nevada. White Pine county was formed in March 1869 and Hamilton was selected as the first county seat. By its peak during the summer of 1869, Hamilton's population was estimated at 12,000. There were close to 100 saloons, several breweries, 60 general stores, and numerous other businesses. There were also theaters, dance halls, skating rinks, a Minersâ€™ Union Hall, and a fraternal order located in the thriving community. Close to 200 mining companies were operating in the area.
