Flora is a town in Madison County, Mississippi. The population was 1,546 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town is named for Flora Mann Jones, an early resident. Graves in Flora's cemetery date to 1821. A post office was established in 1883. That same year, Flora became a stop on the newly constructed Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. The railroad depot is now a museum, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Flora was incorporated in 1886. In 1941, the Mississippi Ordnance Plant was constructed north of Flora to produce propellant and igniter charges for large-caliber guns. The site also had firing ranges for sub-machine guns, rifles, anti-aircraft guns, live grenades, and demolition explosives. A notable employee was science fiction writer Cyril M. Kornbluth. The plant was operated by General Tire, and supported a policy that African-American men were to be employed only as janitors, yard workers, freight loaders, truck drivers and maintenance workers, and could only work in production jobs if white men were not available. African-American women could only be employed as maids and cafeteria helpers. In 1942, a local group of African-American citizens met to protest the company's policy.
