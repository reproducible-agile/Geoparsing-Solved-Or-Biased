Newton (or Newton-in-the-Isle) is a village and civil parish in the Fenland district of north Cambridgeshire, England, four miles to the north of Wisbech. It was formerly also known as Newton in the Isle or Newton on the Isle, where "isle" refers to the Isle of Ely. The village is situated on the Silt Fen, a sea bank formed thousands of years ago. Unlike the salt marshes to the north or the formerly water-logged fens to the south, this narrow strip (also known as the Townland) has been inhabited for many centuries. Its location as a corridor for trade brought wealth to the villages during medieval times in an otherwise relatively poor area. Newton, however, was not listed in the Domesday Book and was thus probably settled later, with its first mention appearing in 1210. The College of St Mary by the Sea was founded here during the reign of Henry IV by Sir John Colville. The lands were given to the rectory of Newton when the college was dissolved by Henry VIII.
