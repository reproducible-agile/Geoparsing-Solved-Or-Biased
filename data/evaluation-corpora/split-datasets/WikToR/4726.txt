Newmarket is an inner north-western suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is located approximately 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the Brisbane central business district (CBD) and is surrounded by the suburbs of Alderley to the north, Ashgrove to the west, Kelvin Grove to the south, and Wilston to the east. It is an older, mostly residential suburb containing pre-war and post-war homes, including many fine examples of the Queenslander style of home. Over the last few years, some medium-density townhouses and unit blocks have appeared as well. Newmarket was originally known as "The Three Mile Scrub" due to its distance from the city, and Ashgrove Avenue, which links Enoggera Road with Waterworks Road to the west, was known as Three Mile Scrub Road. As settlement continued northward along Kelvin Grove Road in the late 19th Century, livestock saleyards opened in the area bordered by Enoggera Road, Newmarket Road, Wilston Road and Alderson Street, and were serviced by Newmarket train station after the rail line was extended from Mayne Junction in 1899. As urban development continued in Newmarket the saleyards were moved to Cannon Hill in 1931. Evidence of the saleyards can still be seen in a number of narrow laneways, most likely old cattle tracks between stockyards, that still exist in this neighbourhood.
