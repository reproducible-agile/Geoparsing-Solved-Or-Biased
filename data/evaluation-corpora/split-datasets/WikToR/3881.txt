Linton is a village in rural Cambridgeshire, England, on the border with Essex. It has been expanded much since the 1960s and is now one of many dormitory villages around Cambridge. The railway station was on the Stour Valley Railway between Shelford and Colchester, closed since 1967. The Rivey Hill overlooks the village, with its famous water tower. The River Granta runs through the village. Linton Zoo is on the southern edge of Linton, whilst Chilford Hall and its vineyards are to the north side, beyond Linton's best-known feature, Rivey Tower. The A1307 passes through the village. The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110 mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. Many businesses are based in Linton, with several around the trading estate at The Grip and along the High Street. Spread evenly along the High Street are the three public houses. The Crown has an attached restaurant. The Dog and Duck focusses on fresh Italian-influenced food and is styled internally on a contemporary European bistro theme. Near the fire station is the Waggon and Horses, which has been resurrected by a new landlord. Although it has been closed for several years, The Bell probably remains Linton's most famous pub.
