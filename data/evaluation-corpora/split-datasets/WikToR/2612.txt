Collinsville is the self-proclaimed "Horseradish Capital of the World", and sponsors an annual Horseradish Festival. The area is said to produce 85% of the world's horseradish, of such high quality that Germany and China (key users of the herb) import it for gourmet use. The Horseradish Festival is always during the first weekend in June and is held at Woodland Park located off of Route 159 in Collinsville. There are many activities for all ages, including a 5K, live music, a beauty pageant, and root grinding demonstrations. One of the most popular events is the Root Derby sponsored by American Family Insurance in which participants make a derby car out of a real horseradish root and race them during the festival.
