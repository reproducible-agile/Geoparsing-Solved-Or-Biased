A Demonstration Battalion, the Army School of Artillery, and armor support from a composite armored battalion in Kaduna were also located at Jaji. In 1978, with the opening of the air faculty, Jaji was redesignated the Command and Staff College. The navy faculty was established in September 1981, assembling all senior military divisions in one campus. In February 2006, authorities were investigating reports from Jari that could indicate the deadly H5N1 avian flu strain had spread to humans. The problem was reported with ostriches suspected of having avian flu virus on the Sambawa Farm in Jaji. Later it spread to other parts of the country.
