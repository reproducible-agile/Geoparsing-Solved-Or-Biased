Savannah is a town in Hardin County, Tennessee. It is the county seat of Hardin County and had a population of 6,917 at the 2000 census. Savannah hosted the NAIA college football national championship game from 1996-2007, and is home to several places of historical significance, including the Cherry Family Mansion and apparently the resting place of the "22nd official(ly) Certified Mainstreet Community" in Tennessee. The city's original name was Rudd's Ferry, named for James Rudd, an early settler who established a ferry at the site in the early 1820s. Rudd's Ferry was later purchased by a wealthy landowner, David Robinson. The town was renamed "Savannah" after Savannah, Georgia, the hometown of Rudd's wife, Elizabeth. Hardin County was the site of the 1862 Battle of Shiloh (also known as the "Battle of Pittsburg Landing") during the Civil War. This battleground site is just south of the town of Savannah. Union General Ulysses S. Grant commandeered the Cherry Mansion just off the town square for use as a headquarters during the battle.
