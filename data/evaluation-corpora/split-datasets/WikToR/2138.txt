Troy is an unincorporated community in rural Wallowa County, Oregon, United States at the conflux of the Grande Ronde and Wenaha rivers. Troy is west of Flora on Oregon Route 3 close to the Washington state line. It is known for its excellent river fishing, and has an RV park and two fishing lodges, as well as a restaurant. There are no other businesses, and the only services are a public school and a county library branch. Troy began to form in the late 1890s, with the establishment in the area of a Mormon settlement called Nauvoo named after the more famous settlement in Illinois. A post office was opened in 1902, and a formal town was platted in 1910. In 1931, the name of the town was officially changed to Troy, presumably honoring a son of the area's original Mormon settlers, Troy Grinstead. A ferry may have already been serving the Grande Ronde River at the location. The town was always a service center for the surrounding farms and ranches, and a "fisherman's getaway paradise" in its relative isolation and lack of commercial enterprise.
