Ota (alternatively spelled Otta') is a town in Ogun State, Nigeria, and has an estimated 163,783 residents living in or around it Ota is the capital of the Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area. The traditional leader of Ota is the Olota of Ota, Oba Alani Oyede. Historically, Ota is the capital of the Awori Yoruba ethnic group. As of 1999, Ota has the third largest concentration of industries in Nigeria. It also possesses a large market and an important road junction, found just north of the tollgate on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. Ota is also well known as the home of former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo's farm, the Canaanland compound of the megachurch Winners' Chapel, and the Africa Leadership Forum. Traditional Awori Yoruba folklore tells that Olofin's children, Osolo and Eleidi Atalabi founded Ota after migrating south from Isheri. As the town developed, it eventually came to be locally ruled by a crowned oba, called the Olota, whose ruling privilege came from the Yoruba traditional home of Ile-Ife. Ota soon became important in the production and sale of cocoa. In 1842, the expansion of the Egba nation brought Ota under the control of Abeokuta, however Ota held a semi-independent status within the Egba kingdom, and remained the capital of the Awori people.
