Haicheng (Chinese: 海城; pinyin: Hǎichéng; literally: "Sea City") is a county-level city of central Liaoning province, People's Republic of China. It is located about 120 kilometres (75 mi) southwest of Shenyang, the provincial capital, and is under the administration of Anshan City, the seat of which lies 36 kilometres (22 mi) to the northeast. Haicheng has an area of 2,734 square kilometres (1,056 sq mi) and a population of 1,130,000. On 4 February 1975, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale hit the city of Haicheng, which at the time had approximately 1 million residents. However, seismologists sent out warnings about this earthquake a day earlier and ordered evacuations. Because of this correct prediction, many lives were saved. This was the first successful earthquake prediction in history. Further aiding the prediction, cats and other animals are also said to have acted strangely in the days leading up to the earthquake. There are some questions as to the validity and accuracy of these reports, which are discussed in detail in the Haicheng Earthquake Prediction link below.
