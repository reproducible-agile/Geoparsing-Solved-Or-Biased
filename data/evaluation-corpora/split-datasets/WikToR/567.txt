Milton (2011 census population 84,362) is a town in Southern Ontario, Canada, and part of the Halton Region in the Greater Toronto Area. The town received a significant amount of attention after the 2006 and 2011 censuses indicated that Milton was the fastest growing municipality in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, with a 71.4% increase in population between 2001 and 2006, and a 56.4% increase in population between 2006 and 2011. In early 2014, Milton's population is estimated to be 102,000 with an estimated growth to 228,000 by 2031. Milton is located 40 km (25 mi) west of Downtown Toronto on Highway 401, and is the western terminus for the Milton line commuter train and bus corridor operated by GO Transit. Milton is on the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO world biosphere reserve and the Bruce Trail. The town took root out of a settlement by Jasper Martin along the Sixteen Mile Creek; Martin immigrated from Newcastle, England with his wife Sarah and two sons on May 17, 1818. Martin was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land, from the Crown in 1820, designated Lot 14, Concession 2, Township of Trafalgar, Halton County, in the District of Gore. Martin later built a grist mill along the creek and created a pond, known as Mill Pond, to power his mill. The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region. In 1837 the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named Milton after the English poet John Milton. The town, as it is today, soon after became known as Milton. The two principal property owners of the young town were the Martins and the Fosters. The current site of Milton's town hall was donated from Mr. Hugh Foster (and thus, Hugh Foster Hall).
