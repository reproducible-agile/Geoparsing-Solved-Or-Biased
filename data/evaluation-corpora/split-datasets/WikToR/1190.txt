Milan /ˈmaɪlən/ is a town in Franklin and Washington townships, Ripley County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,899 at the 2010 census. Milan High School won the Indiana state basketball championship against Muncie Central High School in 1954, the victory being significant as Milan was the smallest town to win a state championship in the United States at that time. The 1986 film Hoosiers is based on the story of the 1954 Milan Team. While it is often claimed that Milan is the subject of a volume of poetry entitled "Pop. 359" written in 1941 by Carl Wilson under the pseudonym of Tramp Starr, that book is actually about the nearby town of Moores Hill.
