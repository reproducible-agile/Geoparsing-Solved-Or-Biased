Roma (also referred to as Romakloster) is a locality (Swedish tätort) situated in Gotland Municipality, Gotland County, Sweden with 913 inhabitants in 2010. Roma Abbey, a ruined medieval monastery and crown estate manor, lies in Roma. In 1995 the locality known as Roma was divided by Statistics Sweden into a part with the tentative name of "Roma kyrkby" or "Lövsta" (pop. 277) and the remaining part that retained the name "Roma" (pop. 913), but is using "Romakloster" as the postal address. Some confusion is caused by the fact that Lövsta/Roma kyrkby has been referred to as "Roma" in the statistical figures since 2000. Roma got a railway connection to Visby in 1878 and was from 1902 the island's main railway hub as a junction for its two main railways. Both lines used the Swedish three-foot narrow gauge (891 mm). The railways were closed in 1953 and 1960 respectively. In 2015, however, the heritage railway Gotlands Hesselby Jernväg was extended to Roma, which thus regained access to rail traffic.
