The town was founded in 1804 on the highest point of the Roanoke River. The most significant historical event of early Hamilton was the battle and fall of Fort Branch, when Union vessels and troops came upriver from Plymouth (see Plymouth, North Carolina History) in an attempt to reach Weldon to cut off supplies to General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The fort protected Weldon until the day after the General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, whereupon the railroad line over the Weldon bridge had no more military significance. Afterwards, the fort was abandoned and the cannons were dumped into the Roanoke River by departing Confederate troops, and were only recently discovered. In July 1972, a group of men from Alabama came and began pulling cannons from the river. The group was accused of violating North Carolina's antiquities laws in an effort to keep the cannons in Martin County. The courts officially decided that the cannons belong to the state under the North Carolina Department of Archives and History. The department decided to permanently loan the artifact to Fort Branch.
