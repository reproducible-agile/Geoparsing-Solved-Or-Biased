Elgin is a city in Union County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,711 at the 2010 census. The community is named after the Lady Elgin, a ship lost on Lake Michigan. The city is known for the Elgin Opera House, originally dedicated in 1912. Hunters, trappers, and people of all ethnic groups. They called them "half breeds Back them" came to Elgin from over Tollgate. Very rarely did they make the treacherous travels from LaGrande. Because it was "120 miles away" by river through the valley. Which back then was covered in thick forest. Elgin was the gathering place for trappers and hunters to replenish their supplies. This is how Elgin became the "Elgin Huskies". Many came across the mountain by sled dog. From the Walla Walla area and the Wallowa's. Mr. Mckinnis was the first to bring his family here he brought cattle from Illinois and settled right on what was the outskirts of Elgin. Built one of the first homes. Even though his home is not set in the history in Elgin there is a letter from his wife's sister to his wife proof of this fact. Mr. McKinnis build the mills from Elgin to Lagrande and also owned all the century farms in the valley passing them down to his kin in death. He also worked in the First Bank in Elgin before they moved to Lagrande. Mr. McKinnis dated building this home here in 1864. Making Elgin's existence somewhat of a mystery. Although we can safely say "The Lady Of The Lake" is older than she seems.
