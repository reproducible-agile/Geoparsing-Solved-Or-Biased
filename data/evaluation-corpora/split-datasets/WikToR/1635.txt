Trindade is a city and municipality in Goi치s state, Brazil. It is famous for the religious celebrations held there in July and is now the third most important pilgrimage site in Brazil. On the west side of the city is a purpose-built raceway where, in 2014, the city hosted a MotoCross World Championship, Grand Prix race. Trindade is part of the Goi칙nia Microregion, which has over one million six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is located approximately 30 km. west of Goi칙nia, to which it is connected by a four-lane highway, GO-060. Although Trindade became a city in 1943, its origins go back to 1840, when, according to local folklore, in a small village called Barro Preto Constantino Xavier and his wife Ana Rosa found in their fields a small clay medallion showing the Holy Trinity crowning the Virgin Mary. Soon a palm covered chapel was raised to be later replaced by a mortar chapel covered with tiles. Lands were donated by local farmers and a religious shrine began to take form. Followers decided to embellish the simple clay medallion and it was taken to Piren칩polis to be worked on by the greatest artist of the region. The original clay medallion returned to Trindade substituted by a wooden representation and that is what is seen by pilgrims today in the main church.
