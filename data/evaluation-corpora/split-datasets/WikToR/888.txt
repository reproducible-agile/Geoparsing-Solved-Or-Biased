Montgomery (Welsh: Trefaldwyn; meaning "the town of Baldwin") is a town in the Welsh Marches, administratively in the Welsh county of Powys. It was previously the county town of Montgomeryshire. The town centre lies one mile (1.6 km) from the English border. Its castle, Montgomery Castle, was started in 1223, and its parish church in 1227. Other locations in the town include The Old Bell Museum, the Offa's Dyke Path, the Robber's Grave and the town wall. The large Iron Age hill fort of Ffridd Faldwyn is sited to the NW of the town and to the W of Montgomery Castle. In the 2011 census, the community of Montgomery had a population of 1295. The town was established around a Norman stone castle on a crag. The castle had been built in the early 13th century to control an important ford over the nearby River Severn and replaced an earlier motte and bailey fortification at Hendomen, one mile away. An important supporter of King William I (the Conqueror), Roger de Montgomery, originally from Montgomery in the Pays d'Auge in Normandy, was given this part of the Welsh Marches by William and his name was given to the town surrounding the castle.
