Almagro (Spanish pronunciation: [alˈmaɣɾo]) is a mostly middle-class barrio (neighbourhood) of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The neighbourhood is delimited by La Plata avenue and Río de Janeiro street to the west, Independencia avenue to the south, Sánchez de Bustamante, Sánchez de Loria and Gallo streets to the east, and Córdoba/Estado de Israel avenues to the north. Almagro features strong commercial activity along its avenues, and has a high population density due to the many high-rise buildings erected along the railway line. The sectional government of the 6th circuit, which includes Almagro and Boedo, is located on Díaz Vélez avenue opposite Centenario park. In the 18th century, what is now the western part of Almagro belonged to Portuguese merchant Carlos de los Santos Valente and then to his estate. The eastern and northern sections were in the possession of Spaniard Juan María de Almagro y de la Torre, a barrister. The Argentine revolutionary government confiscated Almagro's lands, only to return them to him in 1820. Both Santos Valente and Almagro managed agricultural establishments, and did not favor any kind of urban development.
