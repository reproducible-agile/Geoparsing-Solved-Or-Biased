San Esteban is a barangay in Antacudos district of Nabua, Camarines Sur in the Philippines. In 1569, when the Philippines was still a colony of Spain, San Esteban was a part of Rancheria Antacudos of Bua, which was the name of Nabua at that time. The other rancherias were Caobnan, Sabang, Lupa and Binoyoan. Before the Spaniards came, Nabua was ruled by a Muslim Chieftain named Datu Ogbon. Several barangays of Nabua carry his name, such as San Vicente Ogbon and San Antonio Ogbon, among others. The flag of San Esteban, called the "The Steven's Flag", features eight yellow stars on a blue field. At its center are white Star and crescent on a black background. On the upper left part is an orange Greek cross. The eight yellow stars refers to the eight zones of San Esteban: Centro North, Centro South, Likod North, Likod South, Cabuntaran, Magol East, Magol West and Folklands. The star and crescent and orange Greek cross represent the Muslim and Christian citizens of the community. The blue background symbolizes the peaceful co-existence among the people of San Esteban.
