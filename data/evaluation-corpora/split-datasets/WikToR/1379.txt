Cleveland is a town in Emery County, Utah. As of the 2000 census, the town population was 508. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.9 square mile (2.3 kmÂ²), all land. Cleveland is located in a swale of land between the mountains and the desert. It embraces about 480 acres (1.9 km2) and is 7 miles (11 km) northeast of Huntington, 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Price, and 17 miles (27 km) northeast of Castle Dale. Cleveland was first settled in 1884 by Samuel Nelson Alger and Henry Sr. These two men took up homesteading and soon after twenty five-families joined them. Firm roots began to take hold, and gradually with hard work and persistence, Cleveland began to grow. These families were typically pioneers. Cleveland was named after Grover Cleveland who was President of the United States in the 1880s. The "old timers" claim that farms within the boundaries of Cleveland require less water than other farms in Emery County and had the most productive ground. Many of the founding fathers came to Cleveland because of good reports of plentiful grass and good homesteading. The reason that Cleveland was not settled sooner was the lack of a sufficient water source and supply.
