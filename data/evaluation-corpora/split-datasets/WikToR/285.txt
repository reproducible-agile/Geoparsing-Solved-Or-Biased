Toledo City comprises 38 barangays: Toledo City came from Old Hinulawan (now called Daanglungsod) and New Hinulawan. On June 3, 1863 a series of earthquakes shook Hinulawan. The first tremor toppled the newly built school, leveled several houses to the ground, and caused the church fa√ßade to collapse. It caused injuries and fatalities. The quake that followed brought greater damage: complete destruction of the church and the convent; cracking of the lowlands in all directions; crumbling of the stone walls along the Hinulawan river bank; and sagging of the ground, causing water from the sea and the river to flood the settlement to waist level.
