Mount Pleasant is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Isabella County, located in Central Michigan. The population was 26,016 at the 2010 census. Part of the city (with a population of 8,741) is located within the Isabella Indian Reservation, the base of the federally recognized Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation. This is the site of the Tribe's Soaring Eagle Casino. The city is home to the main campuses of Central Michigan University, one of the largest universities in the state with 20,000 students at Mount Pleasant, and Mid Michigan Community College. The student population nearly doubles the population of the city during the academic year. Until the mid-19th century, this area was occupied by historical bands of the Ojibwa people, known by English speakers as the Chippewa. In the early decades of the century, they ceded vast amounts of land to the United States government, which wanted to extinguish Native American land titles to enable settlement by European Americans. The federal Graduation Act of 1854 allowed European-American settlers to purchase land from the government at discount rates, and the first white settlers began to arrive in what became Mount Pleasant. Under the Treaty of 1855, the Ojibwa bands (Saginaw Chippewa Tribe) from the Saginaw, Swan Creek, and Black rivers were relocated to land in Isabella County (Isabella Indian Reservation). Many non-natives soon moved to Mount Pleasant, predicting prosperous relations with the natives. The Homestead Act of 1862 also attracted many new settlers, including new European immigrants, to Mount Pleasant to develop their stake on free lands offered by the US government in exchange for their labor in developing it for residence and agriculture.
