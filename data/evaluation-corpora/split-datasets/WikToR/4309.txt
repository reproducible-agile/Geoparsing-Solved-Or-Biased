Cumberland, also known as Cumberland/Galleria, is a neighborhood in Northwest Atlanta, Georgia, United States, situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of downtown Atlanta. With approximately 122,000 workers and 103,000 residents, Cumberland is the region's fifth-largest business district, and is marked by several modern skyscrapers rising from the wooded hills above the freeways. It is situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of downtown Atlanta at the junction of I-75 and I-285 (the "Cobb Cloverleaf") in Cobb County. Although small portions lie within incorporated Smyrna, the majority of the area is unincorporated and shares ZIP code 30339 with the Vinings area, which the USPS considers to be unincorporated Atlanta. While there are no official boundaries (except for the CID, which is a 5Â½-square-mile area that includes the interchange of I-75, I-285 and U.S. Highway 41), the business district generally extends as far northeast as the Wildwood Office Park on Powers Ferry Road, and up Cobb Parkway, the district's main street. Windy Hill Road is generally the northern extent of the district. To the south and west, it extends down Cumberland Parkway and Paces Ferry Road.
