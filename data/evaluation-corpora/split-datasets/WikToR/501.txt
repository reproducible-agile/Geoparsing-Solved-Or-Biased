Miramar is a small seaside village near the towns of Gulpilhares and Arcozelo, in the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia, in the subregion of Greater Porto, Portugal (Grande Porto). It is an upmarket residential area south of the river Douro, most known for its beach – Praia de Miramar (Miramar Beach) – and the small chapel called Senhor da Pedra (Lord of the Rock), which forms the central attraction of a yearly festival. This chapel is also featured in the film clip "San Simon", directed by Richard Tomes with music by the Pikoul Sisters. Indeed, Miramar is home to a number of artists and intellectuals, including Marina Pikoul, David Wyn Lloyd, Lars Wessman and Diane Braz, amongst others. There are many large houses and mansions in Miramar, as well as in the nearby Praia da Aguda and Praia da Granja. Along the beach there are several cafés ("esplanadas"). Despite its pleasant location, Miramar is not an international tourist destination. However, during the warm summer months, many Portuguese from the surrounding areas of Porto, Gaia and Espinho spend their days at the beach of Miramar, and also at neighbouring beaches of the Costa Verde.
