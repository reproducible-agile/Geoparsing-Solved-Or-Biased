Prospect is a town in Waldo County, Maine, United States. The population was 709 at the 2010 census. The most prominent landmark in Prospect is Fort Knox, a large 19th-century fort. It is now a major tourist attraction, as is the Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory. Originally part of Frankfort, it was settled in 1759 when Fort Pownall was completed at Fort Point on Cape Jellison. Prospect was set off and incorporated in 1794. Land was then set off from Prospect in 1845 to form part of Searsport. Stockton (later Stockton Springs) was set off and incorporated in 1857. Shipbuilding was an early industry. By 1859, the town had one gristmill, three sawmills and a shingle mill. Construction on Fort Knox began in 1844, using granite from Mount Waldo in Frankfort. It was built to defend the Penobscot River and the lumber port of Bangor during the Aroostook War. Although never fully completed, work on the huge defense stopped in 1869. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.20 square miles (52.32 km2), of which, 18.09 square miles (46.85 km2) of it is land and 2.11 square miles (5.46 km2) is water. Drained by the south branch of the Marsh River, Prospect is situated along the west bank of the Penobscot River.
