Richmond is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 3,361 at the 2010 census. The town is on the western border of the county, south of Rochester. Richmond was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The area was first settled around 1790. The town was established in 1796 as "Pittstown," but was later renamed "Honeoye." In 1815, the name was changed to "Richmond." More territory was added to Richmond from the Town of Canadice in 1836. Parts of the Towns of Bristol and South Bristol were added to Richmond in 1848, but were returned to the source towns in 1852. In 1600 the Honeoye Lake Watershed was—apart from clearings made by Native Americans and natural causes such as fire, steep slope landslides, wind or ice—completely forested. The watershed’s primeval forest contained massive trees, some covering as much as a half-acre of ground. Early settlers found these forests useful. Probably the first product to be transported to market was barrels of potash, made from ashes of the burned trees. As sawmills were erected, lumber from the trees cut from 1830 to 1890 were used in the construction of urban centers such as Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse.
