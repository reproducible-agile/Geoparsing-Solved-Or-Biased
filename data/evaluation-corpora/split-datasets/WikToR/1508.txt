Livingston is an unincorporated community located in Madison County, Mississippi, United States. Once a thriving commercial center, Livingston was nearly deserted by the Civil War. Recent commercial and residential development has revived the lost community. In 1829, the county seat was moved from Beatties Bluff to Livingston. A courthouse and jail were built by 1833, and the town was incorporated in 1836. That same year, the county seat was officially moved to Canton, though Livingston "unofficially" remained the county seat until 1858, because its courthouse continued to be used until that year. Livingston became an important trading center for nearby plantations. A Methodist church was established in Livingston around 1830, and there was a Masonic Lodge from 1854 to 1866, when Union forces ransacked and destroyed it. By the 1850s, railways had been established across the county, and Livingston had been bypassed. Most of the town's residents moved and businesses shut down, though the post office remained until at least 1902. The only remains of the original town are a cemetery, and the foundation of the court square.
