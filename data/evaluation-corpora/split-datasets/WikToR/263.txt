San Marcos or San Marcos de Tarrazú is the capital city of the canton of Tarrazú in the province of San José in Costa Rica. It is also the name of the distrito (district) that includes the city. The district of San Marcos covers an area of 42.07 km², and has a population of 8,817. The city lies at an elevation of 1,429 meters above sea level in a mountainous area known as Los Santos, 70 kilometers south of the national capital city of San José. San Marcos de Tarrazu is located in the north bank of the Pirris River, in a highland valley surrounded by mountains that are part of the Talamanca Sierra in southern Costa Rica. Downtown San Marcos is 1350 meters above sea level but is surrounded by peaks as high as 3000 meters above sea level. Its geography is suited to growing coffee, mostly because the slopes of the mountains face the morning light and the cloud cover protects the coffee trees in the afternoon. The red soil found in the valley is of volcanic origin. All this plus the altitude make ideal conditions to grow the coffees harvested by locals.
