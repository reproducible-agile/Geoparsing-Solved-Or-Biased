Villanueva is a town in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Villanueva. Villanueva was founded on February 4, 1692 under the name Villagutierre del Águila. Like many towns in Mexico the name of the patron saint of the town was added to the name and it became Villa de San Judas Tadeo de Villa Gutierre del Águila. However, since it was the last town founded in that area of Zacatecas, it was called Villa Nueva (new town), and that is the name that stuck. Villanueva is one of the 58 municipalities of the Mexican state of Zacatecas. It is located at the southern part of Zacatecas and is bordered in all directions by a number of Zacatecas municipalities. Among the municipalities bordering it are Jerez to the north, Genero Codina to the east, Tabasco to the south and Tepetongo to the west. Some parts of Villanueva have mountainous terrains. It is also crossed by different rivers and other bodies of fresh water. It has a sub-humid temperature and an annual average of 16.9°C.
