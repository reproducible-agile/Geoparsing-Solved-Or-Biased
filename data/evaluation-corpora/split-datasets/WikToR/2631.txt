Karak (Chinese: 加叻) is a small town in the Bentong district of Pahang, Malaysia. It is well known as a rest town (Bandar Persinggahan) of Federal route  from Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan. It also gives its name to the famous Karak Highway, which links it to Kuala Lumpur. Famous Malaysian actors and actress, Daniel Razlan, Mohd Farid Kamarudin, Nona bakar, Sawiyah Jeli and Kalsom Kadir currently live here. Nona Bakar was pioneer for program TV Nona at TV3. With its location at the foothills of Malaysia’s main mountain range, the Titiwangsa Mountain Range, this town is an important water catchment area not just for Pahang but for the Klang Valley as well. The Government has plans to build a massive RM2bil pipeline linking the Pahang River area to Selangor and the Klang Valley. Part of the pipeline will pass through Karak. Ironically, however, the main complaint in this town is the constantly disrupted water supply. Much of the problem stems from an aged water treatment plant, which has been in service for over 30 years and thus is inadequate even for a town the size of Karak.
