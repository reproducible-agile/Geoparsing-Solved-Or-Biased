Candelaria is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. Candelaria is one of the municipalities of the Lempira department. It is located 96 km away from Gracias city, and passing by San Juan del Caite (Intibuca). In terms of time, that is about 3.5 hours of driving on an unpaved road, going up and down through mountains, one of them is "Congolón" where the hero Lempira fought the Spanish conquerors. This road is constantly being repaired all year long by "Fondo Cafetero" and the Government. One must pay attention to all deviations, hopefully there are several houses to ask for direction in any case. Its origins go back to August 3rd 1607, with the name of "San Francisco de Joconguera" and under statement No 5. It became a village in 1872 and on February 20th 1897 it was given the title of municipality under the administration of president Policarpo Bonilla as "Candelaria de Joconguera". It became a city on February 22nd 1939, after Antiguo de la Rañírez led a revolution to liberate the Candelarian people.
