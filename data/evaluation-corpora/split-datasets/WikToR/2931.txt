Mount Carmel is a ghost town in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi, United States. Once a thriving 19th-century community, little remains today of Mount Carmel but a museum located within a historic home. Mount Carmel is one of the oldest settlements in Jefferson Davis County. Mt. Zion Methodist Church was established near Mount Carmel in 1817. John Ragan, a Revolutionary soldier from Virginia, laid out the town in 1819, in what was then Covington County. The plan provided for lots, streets, and a large central square with two springs. Mount Carmel incorporated in 1835, and had two or three stores, and two churches. The town also had a well-regarded co-educational school, Mount Carmel Academy, which opened prior to 1830. At one point it had 70 to 80 students. The school moved in 1845. Benjamin L.C. Wailes traveled through the community in 1852 and wrote in his journal: After crossing [the] Bouie over a bridge (passing through the bottom land in which there is a good deal of large oak & gum mixed with some Shortleaf pine) ascended a considerable eminence to a level table land of Oak and hickory, on which the village of Mount Carmel is situated. About 70 inhabitants. Two or three considerable Country Stores. More business [is] done [here] than at Williamsburg, and the situation is much handsomer, & the buildings (tho' plain frame) [are] better.
