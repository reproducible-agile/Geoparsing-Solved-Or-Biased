Croydon is an inner northern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the City of Charles Sturt. The land on which the suburb now stands was purchased in 1853 by Alfred Watts and Philip Levi. They laid out the Village of Croydon in 1855, comprising Croydon Farm of 40 acres (16 ha) and lots of up to 5 acres (2.0 ha). The village may have been named for Croydon, England, then a part of Surrey, the same county in which Levi had been born. Croydon lies on the western side of South Road, in the section between Port Road and Torrens Road. It is a small inner western suburb of Adelaide. The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,350 persons in Croydon on census night. Of these, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female. The majority of residents (66.6%) are of Australian birth, with other common census responses being Italy (7.4%), Greece (5.9%) and England (2.2%). The age distribution of Croydon residents is similar to that of the greater Australian population. 69.5% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 30.5% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%.
