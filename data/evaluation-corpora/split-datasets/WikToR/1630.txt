Before 1870, what is today known as the Municipality of Mina was then Barrio Montogawe. It got its name from a Montogawe Hill located at the Suague River, that had the appearance of the face of a man. The word Montogawe was derived from the Spanish word “Monte” meaning, mountain, and “Gawe” a vernacular word meaning, face of a man. Old folks claimed that such hill was an enchanted one, because no matter how high the flood was, it never submerged. Thus, the place was significantly called Montogawe.
