Roseville is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north-west of the Sydney central business district. It is within the local government areas of Ku-ring-gai and Willoughby. Roseville Chase is a separate suburb to the east. William Henry was one of Ku-ring-gai's first European settlers, who used the area for farming. There were a few fruit orchards and market gardens in the area. Other significant settlers were David Mathew, who owned a property called Clanville, and Richard Archbold, who was granted an area of 600 acres (2.4 km2) adjacent to Clanville. Archbold later acquired Clanville and set up an orchard on the property. Archbold's son-in-law had a stone cottage called Rose Villa, which was later demolished to make way for the North Shore railway line. Roseville eventually derived its name from Rose Villa. Roseville Post Office opened on 8 July 1901. Roseville East Post Office opened on 1 December 1937. Babbage Road was named for Eden Herschel Babbage (a grandson of Charles Babbage), a retired banker who lived in "Rawhiti" on Clanville Road. Dubbed the "Father of Roseville", he was largely responsible for developing Roseville Park, Davidson Park and Roseville Chase. His brother-in-law, Francis Robert Burton, donated the large pavilion in Roseville Park, following the death in 1913 of brother William Burton, of "Woodlands" on Bancroft Avenue.
