Saint Joseph is an unincorporated community in Yamhill County, Oregon, United States. It is located about two miles west of Lafayette near Oregon Route 99W. The area is sometimes known as "St. Joe". Saint Joseph was named by Ben Holladay, who chose this location as the terminus of the westside line of his Oregon Central Railroad, in order to encourage competition between Lafayette and McMinnville. He probably named the station after Saint Joseph, Missouri, although another source says it was named to honor Holladay's brother Joseph. Saint Joseph post office operated from 1872 until 1878. Holladay had planned to extend the railway south of Saint Joseph down the Willamette Valley, but he ran out of money. Turntables were used to return the train to Portland. Saint Joseph was platted with 74 blocks that each contained ten lots, and at one time the town had 150 houses. There was a two-story hotel, and stagecoaches from McMinnville, Dayton, and Lafayette would meet the train, which brought passengers from the East Coast looking to buy acreage in the area from two companies that were formed to sell land there in about 1900. Henry Villard extended the railroad line from Saint Joseph south to Corvallis in 1878, and McMinnville became the more important railroad terminal.
