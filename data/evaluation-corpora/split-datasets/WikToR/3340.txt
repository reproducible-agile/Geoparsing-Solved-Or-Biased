Milford is an incorporated rural community located in North Central Texas, in the southwestern corner of Ellis County, Texas, in the United States. The population was 728 in 2010. The town is located approximately 14 miles (22 km) northeast of Hillsboro, Texas and 20 miles (32 km) south of Waxahachie, Texas. U.S. Route 77 and Interstate 35E; U.S. 77 is signed locally as the town's Main Street. The community received media attention due to a Chevron gas pipeline explosion and resulting town evacuation which occurred in 2013. Milford dates back to the 1850s, when several men from Cherokee County came to the Mill Creek valley and bought land at 50 cents an acre from Ellis County landowner Arvin Wright. Milford was named by William R. Hudson after a factory town in Massachusetts. During 1853 the first house, a combined residence and general store belonging to William R. Hudson was built, along with a two story schoolhouse which served as church and community hall until it burned during the Civil War. In 1854 Wright, Hudson, and J.M. Higgins laid out town lots atop a ridge. In 1857, a gristmill began operation at the community. Milford was incorporated in 1888, with W.R. McDaniel serving as the first mayor. In 1890, the tracks of the Dallas and Waco Railway (later acquired by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad) reached the community, which became an important shipping point for area cotton farmers.
