Tuba is a first class municipality in the province of Benguet, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 42,874 people. The town is known as the "Gateway to Baguio", as the three major highways that give access to the adjacent city of Baguio are largely traversed in the municipality. Tuba was originally a barrio of the township of Baguio in the early 1900s under the American Occupation of the Philippines. It was separated from Baguio upon the latter's conversion into a chartered city on September 1, 1909, and became part of the township of Twin Peaks in Benguet. Twin Peaks was abolished as a township on December 11, 1911 with the issuance of Executive Order No. 77 by American Governor General William Cameron Forbes, creating the township of Tuba. On June 25, 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Executive Order No. 42 and by operation of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1515, the municipal District of Tuba was converted into a regular municipality. Tuba is situated in the south-western tip of the Central Cordillera Mountain Range that extends from the north-western tip of Luzon towards Pangasinan. South of the municipality lies the province of Pangasinan and to the west lies the Ilocos rolling hills of the province of La Union. It is hemmed in by the municipalities of Sablan and La Trinidad on the north; the city of Baguio and the municipality of Itogon on the east; and the municipalities of Sison and San Manuel on the south.
