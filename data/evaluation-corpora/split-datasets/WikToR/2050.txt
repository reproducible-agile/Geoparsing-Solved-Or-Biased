He appointed authority of the new section to Priest Paul F. Blasco, who went to Bandera and from the communal authority requested the formation of a pro-church commission and provincial school, involving: ulio Hamman, Jose Pedrazzini, Juan Bautista Omacini, Facundo de Martiola, Julian Gongora, Constantino Coppola, Augusto Savi, Natalio De La Llama, Vicente Pintaudi, Toribio Coronel and Inés Paz.
