Woodlands is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its Local Government Area is the City of Stirling and it is in the federal Division of Curtin. Many of the streets in Woodlands are named after trees, such as oak, elm, birch, sandalwood and willow. Woodlands is part of the original 'Woodlands Estate' owned by John Daniel Manning. Thomas William Mews was assigned a parcel of the land in 1831. Mews could not fulfil the required duties, and the grant passed to TRC Walters in 1840. It was later part of the land owned by John Daniel Manning. In 1842 the locality was named 'Jackadup', the Aboriginal name for the area. This was later adapted to 'Jackadder Lake', which is still the name of the lake in Woodlands. Development in Woodlands started in the 1960s. The Floreat Lakes Estate to the south east was subdivided in 1991. Woodlands is part of the original 'Woodlands Estate', which was owned by John Daniel Manning. Part of the area that is now Woodlands was originally assigned to Thomas William Mews in 1831. However, as Mews could not fulfil the location duties, the grant passed to T. R. C. Walters in 1840. It was later part of the extensive lands owned by John Daniel Manning.
