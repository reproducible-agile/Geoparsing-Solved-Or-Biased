Alliance is a village in central Alberta, Canada. Established as a station on a Canadian National (CN) line in 1916, Alliance became a village in 1918. It is located on Highway 602, approximately 160 km (99 mi) east of Red Deer. The village is 2 km (1.2 mi) east of Veterans Memorial Highway (Highway 36) and 2.5 km (1.6 mi) north of the Battle River. Prior to European settlement, the area surrounding the future site of Alliance was, at times, home to First Nations tribes who roamed the plains. The area was also the site of several confrontations between Cree and Blackfoot tribes, giving rise to the name Battle River. At the time of Canadian Confederation in 1867, Alberta was still owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, and European missionaries spread Christianity through the native tribes. In 1904, prior to Alberta becoming a province, homesteaders arrived in the area to establish ranches. By 1910, the area surrounding what is now Alliance was well populated by Europeans, and in January 1916, the Canadian Northern Railway arrived in the young community. The name 'Alliance' was chosen by resident Tom Edwards, who named the community after his home city in the United States, Alliance, Ohio. Shortly after the community's establishment, regular church services began. The first church service was held in a pool hall, with most of the congregation seated on the pool tables.
