Lampang, also called Nakhon Lampang (Thai: นครลำปาง, pronounced [náʔkʰɔːn lampaːŋ]) to differentiate from Lampang Province, is the third largest town in northern Thailand and capital of Lampang Province and the Lampang district. Traditional names for Lampang include Wiang Lakon and Khelang Nakhon. The city is still growing rapidly as trading and transportation center. It offers much of the historic interest of Lanna as well as Chiang Mai, but without the overt commercialization. In the heart of the north, Lampang is also a good base for excursions and travel within northern Thailand. Lampang lies 601 km north of Bangkok and 101 km south-east of Chiang Mai. Lampang city is in the valley of the Wang River, bordered by the Khun Tan Range on the west and the Phi Pan Nam Range on the east. The river, a major tributary of the Chao Phraya, flows through the city. The city lies mainly on the south side of Wang River, although the old parts of the city had been originally developed in the north side of it. Nowadays, the downtown of Lampang has grown in the south-east of the river along Bunyawat and Pahon Yothin Roads, and the main roads of the city are lined by dense commercial and residential buildings.
