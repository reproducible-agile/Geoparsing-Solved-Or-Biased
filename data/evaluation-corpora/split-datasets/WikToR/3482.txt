Hudson is an unincorporated community in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, United States. Hudson is located along Kentucky Route 401, 13.4 miles (21.6 km) southeast of Hardinsburg. Hudson has a post office with ZIP code 40145. In 1810, Joseph Hudson arrived in Breckinridge County, taking land that would forever be known as Hudson. The first settlers at Hudson were George Holmes, Rafeal Cox, Doctor George Legrand, Steve Critchelow (the father of Bill and Tom Critchelow, who ran the mill and blacksmith shop at McDaniels for 60 years), Henry Tucker, and Mac Jauncy. Hudson loaned four of its citizens to the Union Army during the Civil War: Elza Tucker, Bill Tucker, Bill Monroe, and Nic Mercer. All returned safely. During the Civil War, guerillas plundered all the houses in Hudson, stealing all the best horses, and woolen goods and clothing that was of any value. Shortly after the war, Mac Jauncy built a gristmill in the forks of Calimese Creek so people of the community could grind their own meal. This gristmill was powered by a single horse, and had a long sweep pole, which was common for sorghum mills in the area. Even though Mac Jauncy wasn't present to collect any fees, every customer would leave some of their meal in a bin based on the honor system.
