Rockville is a former city in Delaware County, Iowa, United States. Bordering Dubuque County within the North Fork Township, it was approximately 3 miles northwest of Worthington and 1.5 miles west of today's Iowa Highway 136. Rockville was founded in 1845 by Oliver A. Olmstead. Second only to Delhi, it was one of the oldest towns in Delaware County. The area served as an important trading point and included a sawmill, a gristmill, a blacksmith, hotel, and various stores. Slightly predating Rockville's establishment, a log schoolhouse was built in 1843. This would be rebuilt in brick after burning down ten years after its founding. During this era, Rockville served as a stagecoach stop for those heading west of the Mississippi River. The Rockville post office opened June 15, 1846 with Olmstead serving as postmaster, and a hotel was opened for travelers of the Western Stage Company. The town's popularity even saw Charles W. Hobbs, one of the first settlers in Delhi, relocating to Rockville in 1850. Hobbs subsequently opened a store which allegedly found great success.
