Peru is a city in Nemaha County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 865 at the 2010 census. Peru State College is located in Peru. The first attempt to settle the community occurred in 1853 when some residents of Peru, Illinois. However troops from Fort Kearney forced them to leave because Nebraska Territory was still occupied by the Otoe (tribe). They then temporarily settled across the Missouri River at Sonora (now Watson, Missouri). In 1857 a community formed around a trading post called Mount Vernon on the bluffs above the river on the Nebraska side. In 1857 settlers founded Peru down the hill from Mount Vernon directly on the Missouri River. In 1861 a Methodist school called Mount Vernon Academy opened. In 1867 the school (which became Peru State College) became the state's first normal school. Floods in the 1860s changed the course of the river pushing it nearly a mile from Peru. An 1867 flood caused the Nebraska community of McKissick Island northeast of Peru to be surrounded by Missouri land and cause a border dispute that would not be resolved until 1999.
