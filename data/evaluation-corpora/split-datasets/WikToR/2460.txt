Jackson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2010 census, the population was 11,638. Its county seat is Gainesboro. Jackson is part of the Cookeville, TN Micropolitan Statistical Area. Jackson County was created by an act of the Tennessee General Assembly on November 6, 1801. It was the eighteenth county established in the state. It was formed from part of Smith County plus Indian lands. The name honors Andrew Jackson, a U.S. congressman and senator, Tennessee Supreme Court judge, commander at the Battle of New Orleans, and the seventh President of the United States. In the 1790s, an Army outpost named Fort Blount was built 10 miles (16 km) west of Gainesboro on the Cumberland River, in what is now western Jackson County. Fort Blount was an important stop for travellers on Avery's Trace. Williamsburg, a town developed around the fort, served as the Jackson County seat from 1807 to 1819. The county's early records were all lost in a disastrous courthouse fire on August 14, 1872.
