Cuba is a city in Crawford County, Missouri, United States. The population was 3,356 at the 2010 census. Cuba was platted in 1857 when it was certain the railroad would be extended to that point. It was named after the island of Cuba. President Harry S. Truman visited Cuba during a tour of U.S. Route 66. He surveyed the property that would eventually become Indian Hills Lake. Indian Hills Lake was originally known as "Indian Head Lake" because the skull of a Native American was found during excavation. Bette Davis and Amelia Earhart also visited the town. Their visits are commemorated in the Viva Cuba Mural Project. Cuba was designated as the Route 66 Mural City by the Missouri legislature in recognition of Viva Cuba's Outdoor Mural Project. The beautification group consulted with Michelle Loughery, a Canadian muralist who helped create the vision and two of the murals. The group commissioned twelve outdoor murals along the Route 66 corridor. Interstate 44 now runs through Cuba. Cuba was also the site of the first Adopt a Highway program in the Missouri. The Wagon Wheel Motel is a historic landmark and has been a presence on Route 66 since the 1930s. The guest cottages and old Wagon Wheel Cafe building underwent renovations beginning in 2009.
