Dublin is an unincorporated community in Harford County, Maryland, United States. Dublin was founded in the early 19th century by George McCausland and a friend who migrated from Dublin, Ireland. The first record of the village of Dublin is found in the Act of Assembly Districts of the 18th century, which divided the county into election districts and designated Dublin the vote place for the Fifth district. Martenet's map of 1878 shows McCausland built a home on one side of what is now Route 440 and a tavern or inn on the other side. The tavern on the southeast side was a long two story building that was very close to the road. The building had a porch on the first and second stories. In old records reference is made of the Mt. Ararat Lodge of Masons, Maryland, which moved its meeting place in 1809 from a tavern in Delta, Pennsylvania to George McCausland's tavern in Dublin. The lodge remained there until 1826, then moved to the old Masonic Lodge on Bond Street in Bel Air. On the northeast corner of Routes 440 and 136 was a small log house, with a short circular stairway and a fireplace which was used as a school and referred to as "the academy". Along with several of the older homes, it burned in 1971.
