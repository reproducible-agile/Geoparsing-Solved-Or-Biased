Miramar is a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, south-east of the city centre. It is on the Miramar Peninsula, directly east of the isthmus of Rongotai, the site of Wellington International Airport. 'Miramar' means "sea view" in Spanish. The name was chosen by the first European to settle in the area, Scotsman James Coutts Crawford (1817-1889). Crawford was a former Royal Navy officer turned businessman and colonist, who arrived in Wellington in 1840. Crawford established a farm on the peninsula, which at the time was known as Watt's Peninsula, and drained a large lagoon known as Burnham Water. This lagoon covered much of the low-lying land on the peninsula; now this area is occupied by suburban houses, streets, parks and shops. The original MƒÅori name for the area when it was still an island was Te Motu Kairangi (meaning "esteemed" or "precious" island). On 18 November 1904 Miramar Borough was formed. In April 1921, Miramar was incorporated into the City of Wellington. The records of the Miramar Borough Council were transferred to the City of Wellington at the time of amalgamation and can still be accessed today through Wellington City Council.
