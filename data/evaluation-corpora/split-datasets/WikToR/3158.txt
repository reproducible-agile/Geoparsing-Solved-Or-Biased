See Posta and Poşta for disambiguation. Posta (Bengali: পোস্তা) (also known as Posta Bazar) is a neighbourhood in central Kolkata, earlier known as Calcutta, in the Indian state of West Bengal. Once a citadel of Bengali mercantile aristocracy, it is now an extension of the whole sale market in neighbouring Burrabazar, dominated by Marwaris. The wholesale market features a wide range of products such as edible oil, salt, cereals, spices, food grains, sugar, and vanaspati products. The neighbourhood acquired its name from Posta Ghat, a paved stairway in the Hooghly River. The area was earlier occupied by Bengali merchants and bankers, whose riches were legendary. One such merchant was Nuku Dhar, or Lakshmikanta Dhar, who came from Hooghly when it was in decline and settled in Sutanuti. He is believed to have lent the English rulers nine lakh rupees during their campaign against the Marathas. He used to lend money to Robert Clive regularly. It is said that when Nabakrishna Deb approached him for a job, he introduced him to the English and they took him in.
