Angeles, officially the City of Angeles (Kapampangan: Lakanbalen ning Angeles; Filipino: Lungsod ng Angeles) and often referred to as Angeles City, is a highly urbanized city located geographically within the province of Pampanga in the Philippines. It is bordered by Mabalacat to the north; Mexico to the east; San Fernando to the southeast; Bacolor to the south; and Porac to the southwest and west. The city administers itself autonomously from Pampanga and, as of the 2010 census, it has a population of 326,336. Angeles is served by the Clark International Airport in the Clark Freeport Zone. As the former home of Clark Air Base (then the largest United States military facility outside of the continental United States), it was significantly affected by the pullout brought about by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The economy of Angeles was heavily dependent on the American base at that time. In 1993, a full cleanup and removal of volcanic ash deposits began and the former U.S. base re-emerged as Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ). The creation of CSEZ has helped to offset the loss of income and jobs previously generated by the presence of the U.S. base in the city. Today, Angeles and Clark form the hub for business, industry, aviation, and tourism in the Philippines as well as a leisure, fitness, entertainment and gaming center of Central Luzon.
