Bolivar is a city and county seat of Polk County, Missouri, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 10,325. Bolivar began as a settlement around Keeling Spring, with the majority of settlers being from Hardeman County, Tennessee. The settlement became part of Greene County, Missouri when that county was organized in 1833. After the northern part of Greene County was ceded to form Polk County, Missouri, the Polk County Court proclaimed the settlement as a city, named it Bolivar, and designated it as the county seat on 10 November 1835. Bolivar was re-organized as a fourth-class city 15 February 1881. Bolivar experienced growth in 1884 when the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway was extended to that point. The name Bolivar was proposed by John Polk Campbell and his brothers William St. Clair and Ezekiel Madison. The name is after Bolivar, Tennessee where their grandfather and Continental Army Colonel Ezekiel Polk had lived. In the 1830s, both Polk and Bolivar were names locally associated with liberation. As such, Bolivar, Missouri is an indirect namesake of Simón Bolívar.
