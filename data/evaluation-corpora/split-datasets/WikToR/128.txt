Santa Fe is one of Mexico City's major business districts, located in the west part of the city in the delegaciones (boroughs) of Cuajimalpa and Álvaro Obregón. Paseo de la Reforma and Constituyentes are the primary means of access to the district from the central part of the city. Santa Fe consists mainly of highrise buildings surrounding a large shopping mall, which is currently the third largest mall in Latin America (Centro Comercial Santa Fe). The district also includes a residential area and three college campuses, among other facilities. The current area of Santa Fe took its name from the nearby town of Santa Fe, the original Pueblo Hospital founded by Vasco de Quiroga in 1532. During the Spanish colonial era and the first century of independent Mexico, the then town of Santa Fe had an open landscape of sand mining activity, which was divided between the towns of Santa Fe, Santa Lucia, San Mateo and San Pedro Tlaltenango Cuajimalpa. Santa Fe was also connected by the former royal road connecting Tacubaya to Toluca, This royal road was located on the present day avenue called Cuajimalpa Arteaga and Salazar in the Sierra de las Cruces and continued by the current route of the federal interstate highway connecting Mexico City to Toluca.
