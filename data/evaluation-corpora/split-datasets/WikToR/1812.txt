Modern-day Hidalgo was first settled by Spanish colonists led by José de Escandón in about 1749. The colony was known by multiple names: La Habitación, Rancho San Luís, and San Luisito. In 1852, John Young settled in the area and renamed the town Edinburgh after his place of birth, Edinburgh, Scotland; Edinburgh became the county seat of Hidalgo County. The town was incorporated in 1876, and its name was changed to Hidalgo in 1885.
