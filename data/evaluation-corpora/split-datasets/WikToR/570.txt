Milton is a 6th-class city along the south bank of the Ohio River in Trimble County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 525 at the time of the year 2000 U.S. census. The Milton-Madison Bridge connects it to Madison, Indiana, and is the only road link between the two states for 40 miles in either direction. It was the setting for the 1958 film Some Came Running. Milton was settled in 1785 and founded in 1789, at which time it was still part of Virginia. A ferry with Madison, Indiana, on the opposite side of the Ohio began service in 1804. The current bridge connecting them was constructed in 1929. The city has endured many floods and most of its riverside downtown has been repeatedly destroyed, leaving little historic architecture. Two exceptions are Ginn's Furniture Store and the building housing Rowlett's Grocery, both of which are located on Main Street. Milton was hit by a tornado on March 2, 2012. The Milton Fire and Rescue firehouse was destroyed. Milton is located at 38°42.6′N 85°22.5′W (38.7095, -85.3742).
