Shiling (simplified Chinese: 狮岭镇; traditional Chinese: 狮嶺鎮; pinyin: Shīlǐng Zhèn) is a town on the outskirts of Guangzhou, China. Its name means "Lion Ridge", so called because of the local mountain ridge that is shaped like a lion. Shiling Town has long consisted of small farms abutting the mountains from which it gets its name. In the 1970s the government began centrally planned industrialization of Shiling as a leatherworking town. It is now the largest center for the leatherworking industry in China. In addition, its forested mountains and ancient temple make it a tourist destination. Recently, Shiling has seen suburban real-estate redevelopment of some of its land in Western style, with widely space houses, as opposed to the traditional Chinese closely clustered farming communities. Shiling Town (狮岭镇)is located in Huadu District, a suburban district of Guangzhou. The G107 (Guang-Qing Highway), traveling northeast out of Guangzhou, is the major road passing through Shiling. Shiling is 34 km from downtown Guangzhou. The Beijing-Guangzhou railway also passes through Shiling. Shiling was founded as a hamlet (圩) in the Qing dynasty some time during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736—1795).
