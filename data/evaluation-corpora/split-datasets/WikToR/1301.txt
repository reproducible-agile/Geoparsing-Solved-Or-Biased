Washington County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,704. The county seat is Washington. Washington County is included in the Iowa, IA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Washington County was originally formed on January 18, 1838 as Slaughter County in honor of William B. Slaughter, the secretary of Wisconsin Territory. A short time later it was renamed Washington County, in honor of George Washington. The first settlers arrived in Washington County in 1835. The homesteads did not start until 1836. A town was built in the present day township of Oregon named Astoria. It became the first county seat and housed the first court house. In 1839, Washington became the final location of the seat of justice. The first religious society organized by Reverend J.L. Kirkpatrick, a Methodist reverend was created in 1839. The first newspaper was established in 1853; lasting only two years before crumbling. The very next year another newspaper was created, which is still viable today. The major waterways through Washington County are the Skunk and English Rivers and the Crooked Creek. Timber is found in abundance around these bodies of waters which helps in the major business of lumber. Soon after the year 1855, a bank was started in the city of Washington and other institutions followed soon after. No major increase in population happened until the year 1858 when the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was finished through Washington.
