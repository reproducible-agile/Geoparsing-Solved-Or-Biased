Dumbo (or DUMBO, short for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It encompasses two sections: one located between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, which connect Brooklyn to Manhattan across the East River, and another that continues east from the Manhattan Bridge to the Vinegar Hill area. The neighborhood is bounded by Brooklyn Bridge Park to the north, the Brooklyn Bridge to the west, Brooklyn Heights to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of Brooklyn Community Board 2. Originally a ferry landing and industrial area, the entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer David Walentas and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community first becoming a haven for artist galleries and presently a center for technology startups. The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the moniker as "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo has become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth richest community overall, due in part to the large concentration of technology startups, its close proximity to Manhattan and the prevalence of converted industrial buildings into spacious luxury residential lofts.
