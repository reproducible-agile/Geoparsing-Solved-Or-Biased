Miami (/maɪˈæmə/ my-AM-ə) is a city in and county seat of Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,570, a decline of one percent from 13,704 at the 2000 census. The city is named after the Miami tribe. Miami is the capital of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma, Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, Peoria Tribe of Indians and Shawnee Tribe. Miami is part of the Joplin, Missouri metropolitan area. Miami began in a rather unique way, compared to other towns in Indian Territory. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture quotes Velma Nieberding, author of the History of Ottawa County, as saying, "... it was settled in a business-like way by men of vision who looked into the future and saw possibilities. It didn't just grow. It was carefully planned." W.C. Lykins is credited as the driving force for the creation of the town. He petitioned the U.S. Congress to pass legislation on March 3, 1891 to establish the town. He met with Thomas F. Richardville, chief of the Miami tribe, who agreed to meet in turn with the U.S. Indian Commission and the Ottawa tribe. That meeting resulted in Congress authorizing the secretary of the Interior Department to approve the townsite purchase from the Ottawas. Lykins, Richardville and Manford Pooler, chief of the Ottawa, are identified in historical accounts as "fathers of Miami."
