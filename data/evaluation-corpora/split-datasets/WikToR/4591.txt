Butler County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2010 census, the population was 368,130. Its county seat is Hamilton. It is named for General Richard Butler, who died in 1791 during St. Clair's Defeat. It is also home to Miami University, an Ohio public university. Butler County is part of the Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county was once home to seven large earthworks sites, built by ancient Indigenous peoples of the Americas that lived in the area. Early French explorers likely passed through the area along the Miami River. The gravesites of David and Margaret Gregory indicate that they were some of the first white settlers in the area in Liberty Township. White settlers began moving into the area in larger numbers after the 1793 Treaty of Greenville was signed with the Native Americans of the area. Butler County was formed on March 24, 1803 from portions of Hamilton County. It is named for General Richard Butler. Between 1803 and 1823, the townships of the county became officially recognized. Large portions of the county were held by non resident owners, including 640 acres owned by future President William H Harrison. Some land that was originally part of Butler County was later reassigned to Warren County in the north and Hamilton County to the south. The original size of Butler County was 480 sq miles.
