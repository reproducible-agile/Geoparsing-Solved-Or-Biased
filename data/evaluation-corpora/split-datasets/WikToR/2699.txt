Winchester is a ghost town in Wayne County, Mississippi, United States. Once a center of political influence and the county seat, little remains of the original community, which is today covered by forest. Winchester was one of the first significant communities in western Mississippi. It was located about 1 mi (1.6 km) east of the Chickasawhay River, and south of "Three-Chopped Way", a pioneer road completed in 1807 connecting Georgia and the Carolinas, via St. Stephens, Alabama, with Natchez in eastern Mississippi. The town "was situated on a beautiful level site, covered with large oak and other shade trees", and Meadows Mill Creek flowed through Winchester, "a beautiful and never-failing creek of the purest water". A military post—Patton's Fort—was erected at Winchester in 1813 during the Creek War. Winchester became "a place of considerable importance in the territorial period and in the days of early statehood". The town was named Wayne County's first county seat, and was incorporated in 1818. Winchester flourished, and in 1822 a court house was built "of pine lumber of the best quality". A jail was built in the 1840s, with walls "three feet thick of heavy hewed pine".
