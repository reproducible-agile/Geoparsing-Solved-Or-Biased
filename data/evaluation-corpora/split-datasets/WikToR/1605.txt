Newton (Welsh: Drenewydd yn Notais) is a village located near the seaside resort town of Porthcawl, in Bridgend County Borough, Wales. Newton village dates from the 12th century and St John the Baptist Church was founded by the Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem 800 years ago and originally built as a fortress, still overlooks the village green. The Jolly Sailor pub, the oldest in Porthcawl, and the Ancient Briton pub also overlook the green. 130 metres to the south of the church lies St. John's water well, the water from which is reputed to have healing properties. Newton Beach is a long sandy beach, approximately 3 miles long, stretching from Newton Point in the east to the mouth of the River Ogmore in the west. The Newton Burrows and Merthyr Mawr sand dunes back Newton beach, and are a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. The present warren is what is left of what was once the largest sand dune system in Europe, stretching along the coast to Mumbles. The dunes form an important habitat for wildlife and plants, and also claim fame to the second highest sand dune in Europe, locally known as the ‘big dipper’. Some of the filming of Lawrence of Arabia took place on the dunes.
