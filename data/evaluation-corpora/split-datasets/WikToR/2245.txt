The Town of Mountain View is a Home Rule Municipality located in Jefferson County, Colorado, United States. Mountain View is situated west of, and adjacent to, the City and County of Denver. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the town population was 529 on 2005-07-01. The Denver Post Office (ZIP Code 80212) serves Mountain View. Mountain View was incorporated in 1904 on the land occupied by the Berkeley Annex subdivision established in 1888, which itself was part of the Berkeley Farm founded by John Brisben Walker in 1879. The town grew to approximately 500 residents living in 272 houses by 2008, with approximately 20 businesses in operation, but occupying a total of only 12 square-blocks "sandwiched between Wheat Ridge and Denver." By 2009, the town was going through a bit of an existential crises. Several businesses closed down, sales taxes declined, and city workers were paid late on three occasions over two months. The Town Council added a US$162 fee to sewer bills in order to maintain basic services. The Government of the State of Colorado stepped in to pay for getting the city's financial records in order. The Town wrote a letter to city residents saying: " 'Our town is in serious trouble and we need your help!' [offering] three options: Get some more businesses into town, unincorporate and be absorbed into Jefferson County or let a neighboring community annex the town."
