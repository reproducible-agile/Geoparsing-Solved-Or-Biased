Ferndale is a southeastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Canning. It is approximately 15 kilometres (9 mi) from Perth's central business district. The name Ferndale originated from developers who decided not to proceed with the City of Canning's choice of Shearnstead. In 1965, the name change was approved. The eastern section of Ferndale Crescent was once Menzies Road. Low scrub forest covered most of the suburb until developed in the late sixties and seventies. Ferndale is bounded by Metcalfe Road to the south-east, the Canning River to the north and north-west, and Bannister Creek to the south-west. Its main street is Ferndale Crescent, which runs like an inverted U-shape from Metcalfe Road - the eastern leg of the street serves as a "centre line" to divide south-west and north-east Ferndale. Prominent features of the suburb also include Ferndale Reserve, a large sports ground; and the small Ferndale Shopping Centre. The Canning River Regional Park, located in Ferndale's north, is a popular route for cycling and walking as it is the parkland of the Canning River.
