Davis, Massachusetts is the abandoned location of the Davis Pyrite Mine. Once the largest iron pyrite-mine in Massachusetts, Davis grew to be a decent sized mining village at the beginnings of the Second Industrial Revolution (1870–1915). But, in 1911, a non-fatal collapse of the mine due to “poor mining practices” ended the nearly 30-year run. By 1937, the mining camp had faded, and all that remained were a blacksmith shop and about 150 cellar holes. Davis is located at 42°41′52″N 72°52′13″W. The abandoned mining village is located in the Town of Rowe, in Franklin County, about three miles north of Charlemont and two miles south-southeast of Rowe. The area is east of Davis Mine Road and west of Davis Mine Brook. Both Rowe (2000 pop - 351) and Charlemont (2000 pop - 1358) are picturesque small towns in the rolling hills of northwestern Massachusetts. Both communities have a long heritage. Rowe was established in 1762 and incorporated in 1785, and Charlemont was established in 1742 and incorporated in 1765. It was in the wooded hills between the two towns that an iron pyrite outcrop was discovered and a mine developed by H.J. Davis around 1882. The eastern section of Rowe, called Davis, became the center of activity because of the profitable operation of Davis Sulfur Ore Mine for twenty-nine years. The Davis Mine supplied a major economic boost to both Rowe and Charlemont.
