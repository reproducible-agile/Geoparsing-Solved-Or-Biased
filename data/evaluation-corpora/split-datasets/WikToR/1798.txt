Conway is a town in Franklin County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 1,897 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. Conway was first settled in 1762 as the southwest portion of Deerfield. The town was eventually separated and was officially incorporated in 1767. The town was named for General Henry Seymour Conway, a leader in the British House of Commons during repeal of the Stamp Act. (Conway, New Hampshire, as well as other towns across the country, were also named for him.) The town was known for its sheep farming and other agrarian pursuits in its early years, with some industry along the South River which was washed out in a dam break in 1869.
