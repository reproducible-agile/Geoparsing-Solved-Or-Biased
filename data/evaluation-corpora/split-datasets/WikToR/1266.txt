Pasadena is an incorporated town located in census division 5 which is in the western portion of Newfoundland, Canada and it is a picturesque community on the shores of Deer Lake at the junction of the North Arm Valley and the Humber Valley. The town was named after Pasadena, California. The meaning of the name is sometimes claimed to be "crown of the valley". The Town of Pasadena claims the name is Spanish for "crown of the valley". However, the name, first applied to the city in California, is a corruption of an Ojibwe phrase meaning "valley" or "of the valley". The founders of Pasadena, California, claimed it was Ojibwe for "crown of the valley" or "key of the valley" when in fact it only meant, roughly "of the valley". The Town of Pasadena formerly consisted of three separate communities: South Brook, Pasadena and Midland. South Brook was located on the sandy shore of Deer Lake. It evolved much earlier than Pasadena, starting out in the early 1920s as a logging camp for the Bowater Company from Corner Brook. The railway also used South Brook, but only as a stop along its route across the island. In 1921, the census showed that South Brook only had a population of 6 people, within 2 families.
