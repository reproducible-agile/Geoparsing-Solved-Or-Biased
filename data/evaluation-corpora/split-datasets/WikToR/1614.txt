Newport (Welsh: Trefdraeth, meaning: "town by the beach") is a community, town and ancient port (Parrog) on the Pembrokeshire coast in south-west Wales, at the mouth of the River Nevern (Welsh: Afon Nyfer) in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. A popular tourist destination, Newport town straddles the A487 Fishguard to Cardigan road, while the old port area hosts many beach, water and other activities. Newport is twinned with the village of Plouguin in Finist√®re, Brittany and Annapolis, Maryland, USA. The town was founded by the Norman William FitzMartin (c.1155-1209) in about 1197. He was a son-in-law of the Lord Rhys, who nevertheless expelled him from his former base at nearby Nevern, which had been established by his father Robert fitz Martin. William founded Newport as the new capital of the Marcher Lordship of Cemais and it was a busy port founded primarily on the growing medieval wool trade. Despite seizure from the native Welsh, it remained within the FitzMartin family until the death of William, the 2nd Lord Martin, who died without male heir in 1326.
