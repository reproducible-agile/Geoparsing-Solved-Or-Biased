The city was named for Austin Nichols, an early settler, who arrived in 1853. At that time there were "about twenty families in the area." More settlers began to arrive by wagon train in 1855, and by 1856, enough people were present to organize a county, Mower County. "The first newspaper, the Mower County Mirror, was started in 1858."
