Anda is a third class island-municipality in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. The people of Anda generally speak Pangasinan, Bolinao, and Ilocano. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 37,011 people. The municipality consists primarily of Cabarruyan Island (also known as Anda Island), as well as minor surrounding islets. Because of Anda's proximity near the Hundred Islands, a popular tourist destination for its caves and beaches, it is the so-called "Mother of the Hundred Islands." Anda is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. On the north-west portion of Lingayen Gulf lies a group of islands which comprise the territory of Anda. Before the middle of the nineteenth century, the islands which comprise the municipality were uninhabited. Only occasionally did seafarers and fishermen use the coast as havens. Andres de la Cruz Cacho, fondly called in Bolinao as Andales Kulayo, discovered a vast tract of land suitable for grazing and fertile lowlands, and an abundant spring for agriculture. It was he who brought families from the town of Bolinao aboard a big boat and dispersed them on the island of Cabarruyan in 1842. The spread of population was rapid.
