San Martin (/ˈsən mɑːrˈtiːn/) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Clara County, California, United States. It takes its name from St. Martin of Tours, the patron saint of early pioneer Martin Murphy, who built the first Catholic church in the area. The community has been considering incorporating into either a city or town since 2004, but no official action had been taken by the end of 2010. The population was 7,027 at the 2010 census. Like neighboring Morgan Hill and Gilroy, San Martin is a large producer of garlic, table mushrooms, and wine. It is also home to the volunteer-run Wings of History aviation museum, located next to South County Airport. San Martin is located at 37°05′16″N 121°36′00″W (37.087746, -121.600020). It is approximately 48 km (30 mi) south of San Jose, California, 11 km (6.8 mi) north of Gilroy, California, and 24 km (15 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Lying in a roughly 6 km-wide (4-mi-wide) southern extension of the Santa Clara Valley, it is bounded by the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and the Diablo Range to the east.
