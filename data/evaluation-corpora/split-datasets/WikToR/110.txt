Richmond is a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, 3 km south-east of Melbourne's Central Business District in the local government area of the City of Yarra municipality. The 2011 Census listed Richmond's population as 26,121. Three of the 82 designated major activity centres identified in the Melbourne 2030 Metropolitan Strategy are located in Richmondâ€”the commercial strips of Victoria Street, Bridge Road and Swan Street. The diverse suburb has been the subject of gentrification since the early 1990s and now contains an eclectic mix of expensively converted warehouse residences, public housing high-rise flats and terrace houses from the Victorian-era. The residential segment of the suburb exists among a lively retail sector. Richmond was home to the Nine Network studios, under the callsign of GTV-9, until the studios moved to Docklands in 2011. Dimmeys is long associated with Richmond, although it is located in the neighbouring suburb of Cremorne. The suburb is well known for its popular factory outlets along Bridge Road, remaining an attraction to the area. Richmond is well known for its vibrant and popular Little Saigon area along Victoria Street; however, the area is also recognised for the illicit drug dealing (especially heroin) that occurs in both street-based and domestic contexts.
