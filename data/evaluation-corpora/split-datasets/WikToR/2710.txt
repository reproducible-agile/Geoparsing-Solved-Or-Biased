Tampa is an unincorporated community in Weld County, Colorado, United States. The rural community is served by an 80643 ZIP code. Old timers in the area advise that Tampa was a departure point for an old railroad spur called the Tampa Spur. Tampa was located on the old CB&Q line (now BNSF, Burlington Northern, Santa Fe), about halfway between Roggen and Keenesburg. Old timers advise that the Tampa Spur was a 1.5-mile-long railroad spur between Tampa and a place to the south called Sheehan, near the Prospect Valley, and that the spur functioned as a sugar beet dump. (A beet dump was an elevated facility that allowed farmers to deposit newly harvested produce into open railroad cars.) According to these old timers, the Tampa Spur was built in 1882. It was still on the railroad maps in 1983, but does not appear on current railroad maps. Tampa is located at 40.149982 degrees north, 104.455512 degrees west (27.1499982, -104.455512); or about 5.5 miles northeast of Keenesburg.
