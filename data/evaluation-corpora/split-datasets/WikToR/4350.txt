Harrow is a town in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia. The town is located in the Shire of West Wimmera local government area, 391 kilometres north west of the state capital Melbourne, overlooking the Glenelg River valley. At the 2011 census, Harrow and the surrounding area had a population of 315. The first European explorer of the area was Thomas Mitchell and a monument marks the spot where he crossed the Glenelg River. A town originally known as Upper Glenelg was established in the 1840s and is claimed to be the oldest inland town in Victoria. The Post Office opened on 1 March 1849 as Upper Glenelg (Harrow from 1854). At its peak, the town included a range of shops and services including two hotels. Harrow is the burial place of Unaarrimin - Johnny Mullagh, member of the Australian Aboriginal cricket team, the first Australian cricket team to tour England. He also represented the Victorian cricket team in first-class cricket. To tell the story of Unaarrimin, and the times in which he lived, Harrow has built The Johnny Mullagh / Harrow Discovery Centre. To enhance the cricket connection, the Centre now houses Australia's largest Sir Donald Bradman exhibition.
