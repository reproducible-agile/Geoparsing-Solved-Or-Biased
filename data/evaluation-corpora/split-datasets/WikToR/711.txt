Weston is a village in Tophill on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It abuts the main village Easton. As with the rest of Portland's villages and settlements, Weston has been designated as a conservation area, as it is a place of special architectural and historic interest. The village was designated in 1994. The village grew up through the industry of agriculture, with Weston being surrounded by strip fields, also known as lawnsheds. It is likely that Roman occupation saw the development of Weston as a village, by establishing the various ponds and wells. Weston remained a small settlement for many centuries. From the 19th-century, housing had caused the large expansion of many of Portland's villages, although Weston remained a small settlement. The early 20th-century saw inland quarrying beginning to destroy some of Weston's surrounding fields. The second half of the 20th-century saw Weston's undergo extensive changes, with the major expansion of the village. During the 1960s, large housing estates were placed on either side of the village, towards the western cliffs, and Easton village. The building of the Haylands housing estate commenced during the late 1960s. The construction of the Weston Estate at West Cliff was originally for the Admiralty, but was later sold as private housing. This estate continued to expand throughout the 1970s. Despite the expansion, Weston is still set amongst expansive fields to the east and south.
