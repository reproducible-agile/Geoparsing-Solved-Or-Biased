The Town of Edinburg is in the northwest part of the county and is north of Schenectady. It is within the Adirondack Park. The Town of Edinburg is located within the Adirondack Park on the shores of the Great Sacandaga Lake in northwestern Saratoga County. The first recorded settlers arrived in the Sacandaga River Valley area via Fish House in 1787. Abijah Stark came with his family from Coleraine, Massachusetts and settled first just north of Fish House near the Providence town line. They were followed shortly by the Andersons, Westcotts, Randall and Bass families These people came because of the tall, virgin pine forests, fertile lands of the river valley and more "elbow room." Many of these heads of households had seen the valley before, when serving their country during the Revolutionary War. They had heard that land here was cheap and "the living was better for less work."
