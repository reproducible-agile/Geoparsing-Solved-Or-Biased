Taishi (太子町, Taishi-chō) is a town located in Ibo District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. As of 2011, the town has an estimated population of 34,503. The total area is 22.62 km². Originally the Ibo District was divided into three towns (Ibogawa, Shingū, Mitsu). In October 2005 the three towns along with the town of Tatsuno merged into a single city bearing the name of Tatsuno. The merger left Taishi as the sole remaining independent town of the Ibo District. Separate plans have been laid out respectively for the merger Taishi and Tatsuno, and the merger of Taishi and Himeji into a single municipal district. The city is enveloped to the west by the city of Tatsuno, and to the east by the city of Himeji. 1931 - The town of Ikaruga was incorporated on present grounds of Taishi. 1951 - The villages (mura) of Sekkai and Ōda were merged with Ikaruga to form Taishi. 1955 - The village of Tatsuda was incorporated into Taishi. Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) - Influential nobleman known for both swordplay and penmanship; born in Taishi; noted in the collection of writings known as the Harimakagami. The fact is possibly apocryphal as many cities lay claim to his birthplace.
