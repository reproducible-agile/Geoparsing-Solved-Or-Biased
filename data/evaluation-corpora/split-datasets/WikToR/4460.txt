Bambang is a first class municipality in the province of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 47,657 people. The municipality is known for its salt springs at the Salinas Natural Monument. Bambang has its beginning in the early period of Spanish colonization. The name "Bambang" is an Isinay word meaning "to dig". The first mission that dared to penetrate the dangerous wilderness and insect-infested jungles of what is southern Nueva Vizcaya today was by the Dominican Order in 1607. However, it was only two years later (1609) when a Dominican missionary come from Pangasinan. Father Tomas Gutierez arrived to establish the first missionary settlement. This settlement was subsequently called Ytuy which today actually comprises the towns of Aritao, Dupax, Bambang and a part of the Igorot tribal lands to the west (now Kayapa). Originally these places were inhabited by the Aetas and Panuypuyes (Aritao), the Ilongots (Dupax and Bambang) and the lgorot in the area west from the present native population of Dupax, Aritao, and Bambang came about by the inter-marriages of the tribes mentioned above.
