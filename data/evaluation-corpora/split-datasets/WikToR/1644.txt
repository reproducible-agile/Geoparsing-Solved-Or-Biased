Population: 379 (2010 est.), of which 317 were indigenous peoples. Population: 384 (2010 Census);  Municipally, Ostrovnoye is subordinated to Bilibinsky Municipal District and is incorporated as Ostrovnoye Rural Settlement. Ostrovnoye is a historical locality in the region, as it was the site of an ostrog built as Russians began to explore and lay claim to the region, and was the site of trade fairs between Russians and natives. The ruins of the Ostrog are still visible not far from the village. Since the beginning of the 18th century Russian explorers began active exploration of Kolyma and Chukotka, and the settlements they established were essentially fortresses, among them Anyuysky Ostrog, where the Anyuysk Fair was held, the largest in Chutkotka. The Ostrog was situated on an island in the Lesser Anyuy. However, because of constant spring flooding of the river the fair was repeatedly postponed until 1848 after a flood, which destroyed most of the island and the Ostrog itself, the settlement was moved to the left bank, 10 km downstream. However, the locals traditionally called this fortress "Island" and so that was the name that was assigned to the modern village, standing on the site of the former Ostrog.
