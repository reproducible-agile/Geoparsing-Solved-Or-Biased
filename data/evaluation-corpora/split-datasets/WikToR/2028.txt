For the Burton near Tarporley in Cheshire, see Burton, Gowy Burton is a village on the Wirral Peninsula, in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It constituted part of the Burton and Ness Ward of the Borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston, with the ward having a total population of 1,620 in the 2001 Census. It is now in Ledsham and Willaston Ward. Burton was first documented in the Domesday Book and historically was on the route which travellers would take from London to Birkenhead. Owing to its location on trade routes, it is thought to have developed at a faster rate than neighbouring communities. Indeed, during the fourteenth century trade and travel allowed Burton to flourish, standing as it did near the site of embarcation for the ferry to North Wales and on the main route to the city of Chester. However, the build up of silt in the River Dee led to a decrease in shipping trade, and Burton's prosperity took a downturn when the river course was diverted in the eighteenth century.
