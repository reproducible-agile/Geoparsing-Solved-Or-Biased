Ibi is a town and administrative district in Taraba State, Nigeria. The town is located on the south bank of the Benue River, opposite the influx of the much smaller Shemankar River. Both the Taraba River and the Donga River flow into the Benue within the LGA. Ibi is one of the sixteen local government areas of Taraba State, and is governed by an elected chairman. Ibi was located where the traditional land trade route of eastern Igboland crossed the river trade route of the Benue River. It was part of the Jukon kingdom (1720-1815) whose capital, Kororofa, was 35 miles east (up river). After the Fulani invasion Ibi became part of the Muri Emirate (1817-1892). Like the rest of Muri it was under the French governor Louis Mizon from 1892-1893. By 1899 the Niger Company established a trading station at Ibi, and by 1901 telegraph service to Lokoja had been established. The British took control in 1900 and established Ibi as the administrative headquarters of western Muri. As cotton was one of the major crops of the area, steam powered cotton gins were established in Ibi in the early 1920s.
