Waterloo is an area of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside, England. Waterloo is home to The Plaza Community Cinema and three primary schools. There is also Crosby Beach, which begins in Waterloo and stretches 3 miles up to Blundellsands. It is the location of Antony Gormley's Another Place. It is mainly connected to Liverpool by Waterloo railway station. Historically part of Lancashire and originally an area of Crosby, named Crosby Seabank, it consisted mostly of sandhills and fields. One of the first major buildings in the area was opened on 18 June 1816, the first anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, and was named the Royal Waterloo Hotel in honour of the event. Gradually, as population increased and the area became an identifiable location, it became known as Waterloo. Some of the buildings in Waterloo for example, the Grade II Listed Potters Barn park buildings are replicas of the ones found in Waterloo, Belgium. Ironically, the name Waterloo was dropped from the original building, which still stands, and it is now known simply as the Royal Hotel.
