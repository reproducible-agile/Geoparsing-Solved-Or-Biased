Ivangorod (Russian: Иванго́род; Estonian: Jaanilinn; Votic: Jaanilidna), also known as Ivan-Gorod (Ива́н-Го́род), is a town in Kingiseppsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of the Narva River by the Estonia–Russia border, 159 kilometers (99 mi) west of St. Petersburg. Population: 9,854 (2010 Census); 11,206 (2002 Census); 11,833 (1989 Census). Ivangorod is a major border crossing point and a railway station by the Tallinn–St. Petersburg line. It is located just opposite to the Estonian town of Narva. The town is the site of the Ivangorod Fortress, a prominent fortification monument of the 15th and the 16th centuries. The fortress was established in 1492 during the reign of Ivan III of Moscow and was named after him. Between 1581–1590 and between 1612–1704, it was controlled by Sweden. Ivangorod was granted town privileges and administered as a Russian township under the Crown of Sweden (who conquered it in 1612 from boyar Teuvo Aminev) until 1649, when its burghers were ordered to remove to a Narva suburb. In 1617, the Treaty of Stolbovo was signed between Russia and Sweden, which placed the area under the Swedish sovereignty. Russia reconquered it during the Great Northern War in 1704. Despite other changes in territory and sovereignty, Ivangorod was considered an administrative part of the town of Narva from 1649 until 1945. In 1780, Ivangorod, together with Narva, was included into Narvsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. In 1796, Narvsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Yamburgsky Uyezd.
