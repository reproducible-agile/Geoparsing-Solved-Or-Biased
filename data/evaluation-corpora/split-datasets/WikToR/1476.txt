Burlington is a city in Skagit County, Washington, United States. The population is 8,388 as recorded by the 2010 census. It is included in the Mount Vernonâ€“Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. Burlington began as a logging camp, established by John P. Millett and William McKay, in 1882. It was officially incorporated on June 16, 1902. Burlington is locally famous for its proliferation of shopping malls and for having some of the best youth sports fields in Washington. In 2007, the city opened a new library  and city hall. Originally, Burlington's businesses were centered around Fairhaven Avenue. Today, Fairhaven Avenue is the center of Burlington's old downtown, and provides a gathering place for the whole city during the annual summer Berry Dairy Days. Berry Dairy Days was originally simply known as the Strawberry Festival, and served as a fundraiser for the town's fire department for many years. A 1954 article described a gigantic strawberry shortcake that was the centerpiece of that year's festival: it consisted of 60 sheets of sponge cake that took 12 hours to bake, and claimed to be the largest strawberry shortcake in the world.
