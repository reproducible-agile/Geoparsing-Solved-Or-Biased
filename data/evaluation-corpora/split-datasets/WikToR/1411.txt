Augusta is a town in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 2,020 at the 2010 census. The Town of Augusta is in the southwest part of the county. Augusta was settled in 1793 by a man named Gunn, whose son, Peter Smith Gunn, was the first child born in the town. The first attempt to organize the town was in 1797. A bill was considered in the New York State Legislature and passed the Assembly, but failed in the Senate because Senator Samuel Jones noted that town officers must be freeholders and many of the prospective town officials were lessees of Peter Smith's land. Organization was successful the next year and Augusta was created as a town simultaneously with the creation of Oneida County on March 15, 1798. It was created from part of the town of Whitestown. The first town meeting was held on April 3, 1798. The following positions were filled: Town supervisor, Town Clerk, Assessors (4), Commissioner of Highways (3), Overseers of the Poor (2), Constable and Collector, Inspectors of Schools (3), Fence viewers (3).
