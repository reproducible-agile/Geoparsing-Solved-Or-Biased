The town was established from a village, which is still remaining near the present center of the town, during the Qing Dynasty. The village experienced fast growth when the main part of the Zhejiang–Jiangxi Railway was completed in 1935. Nowadays, Xiangtang has two main rail stations: Xiangtang West Station as the second largest freight yard in China and Xiangtang Station as a level-1 passenger station nationwide. It also had the only civilian airport(joint military/civilian) in Jiangxi province before Nanchang Changbei International Airport went to operation in September 10, 1999. There are 33 government-owned institutions and about 4000 researchers and technicians working here. In 1999, Xiangtang became a provincial level development zone and boosted the medical, chemical, clothing, material industry and education.
