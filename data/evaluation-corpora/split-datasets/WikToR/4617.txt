Eastern Province is one of Zambia's ten provinces. The province lies between the Luangwa River and the border with Malawi, from Isoka in the northeast to just north of Luangwa in the south. The provincial capital is Chipata. The province's population was 1,592,661 in the 2010 census - about 6.84% of Zambia's total population. For more details see Eastern Province in the Wildlife of Zambia South Luangwa National Park (although most of it lies outside the province, its management and the only public road access is from the province). North Luangwa National Park is in Northern Province but access and management is from Eastern Province. Luambe National Park Lukusuzi National Park Game Management Areas cover most of the Luangwa Valley outside the national parks, and many animals migrate through Eastern Province between the valley and game reserves in the highlands of neighbouring Malawi. Eastern Province was formerly divided into 9 districts: Chadiza District Chipata District Katete District Lundazi District Mambwe District Nyimba District Petauke District Sinda District Vubwi District However, Chama District was transferred to the new Muchinga Province when the latter was created in 2011.
