Shrewsbury is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The town was named for the Earl of Shrewsbury. The population was 1,056 at the 2010 census. Shrewsbury is the home of former U.S. Senator Jim Jeffords. In 1986/87, the town received worldwide attention from the media, when a moose spent 76 days unsuccessfully courting a local farmer's cow. A book, A Moose for Jessica was written about the story. There are several local businesses, including a breakfast restaurant called Over Easy's, a hair salon (Cuttings In The 'Ville), a Ford dealership (Stewart Ford), its first ever Real Estate Office (Evergreen Realty of Vermont) and a number of small businesses. However, the vast majority of citizens work outside of the town, many in nearby Rutland. The town has a small elementary school (Shrewsbury Mountain School), and the high school students attend Mill River Union High School in Clarendon. The meetinghouse, located in Shrewsbury Center, houses the community church and is host to activities such as a talent show and contra dances. The fire department is made up of volunteers and is located in Cuttingsville. There is also a small volunteer library.
