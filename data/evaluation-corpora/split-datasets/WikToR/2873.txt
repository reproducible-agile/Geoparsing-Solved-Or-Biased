Burbank is a large, greenbelt suburb in south-east Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It has been claimed the suburb was named after Alfred Harry Burbank, a surveyor and farmer, who was a resident in the area from 1890 to 1908, or that it was named after Frank Burbank, a local horse dealer. Mount Petrie lies just to the north of the suburb. Burbank has a number of small intermittent creeks winding between cleared and uncleared rolling hills. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 1,137. The main road across in the area is the Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road. There are also a couple of working and hobby farms. There are a few palm nurseries and at least two turf farms in the area. Burbank has a number of churches and temples and there is a jewish school. The closest public primary school is Mount Petrie State School in Mackenzie. There are no shops in the suburb and public transport is very limited. The almost entirely residential outer suburb is dominated by large acreage blocks, many with extensive gardens and prestige housing built on them. A large dam built in the late 1960s has shaped the modern development of this area. Called the Leslie Harrison Dam, it forms the Tingalpa Reservoir on Tingalpa Creek. The dam provides water for thousands of users in Redland City. Because of water quality concerns the population density has been kept low within the immediate catchment area.
