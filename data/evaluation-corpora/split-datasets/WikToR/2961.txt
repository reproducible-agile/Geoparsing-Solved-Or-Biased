In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Dickinson County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Hope. In 1871, a group of about forty people, led by Newell Thurstin, began planning a town site in Hope. The town is said to be named after one of Thurstin's sons. The first post office in Hope was also established in July 1871. David Jacob Eisenhower, the father of US President Dwight David Eisenhower, lived in a 160-acre (0.65 km2) ranch near Hope from 1878 to his enrollment at Lane University. He and his partner, Milton Good, operated a general store here in 1885.
