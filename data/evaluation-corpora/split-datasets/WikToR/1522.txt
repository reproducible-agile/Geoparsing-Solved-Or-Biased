The former estate village of Easton in England is situated on the River Deben around three miles (5 km) south of Framlingham. The population of the village at the 2011 Census was 331. Following the end of the World War 1 the British government imposed super taxes on the rich to help defray the cost of the war. Faced with these taxes and with the cost of restoring Easton from it use as a Red Cross Hospital during the war the Duchess of Hamilton and her husband, Lord James Graham decided to sell the estate. The land was divided into 137 lots and sold by auction in 1919. The sale attracted a great deal of attention and raised £58000 (£4.6 million today) but the Mansion and its 150-acre (0.61 km2) parkland remained unsold. It was sold privately for £11,278 (£900,000 today)and the parkland was transferred to Martley Hall. With very little land the Mansions fate was sealed and in December 1924 demolition began. Some of the artifacts were removed and incorporated into Martley Hall and other local houses. Easton is also the home of Easton Farm Park, a farming museum with a selection of rare breeds and other countryside related activities.
