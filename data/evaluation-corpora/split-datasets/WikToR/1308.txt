Washington County is a county located in the U.S. state of Vermont, named after George Washington. As of the 2010 census, the population was 59,534, making it the third-most populous county in Vermont, but the second-least populous capital county in the nation, after Hughes County, in South Dakota. Its county seat is the municipality of Montpelier, the state capital. The county was created in 1810 as Jefferson County and organized the following year. Washington County comprises the Barre, VT Micropolitan Statistical Area. In 2010, the center of population of Vermont was located in Washington County, in the town of Warren. Washington County is one of several Vermont counties created from land ceded by the state of New York on January 15, 1777 when Vermont declared itself to be a distinct state from New York. The land originally was contested by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Netherland, but it remained undelineated until July 20, 1764 when King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. New York assigned the land gained to Albany County. On March 12, 1772 Albany County was partitioned to create Charlotte County, and this situation remained until Vermont's independence from New York and Britain.
