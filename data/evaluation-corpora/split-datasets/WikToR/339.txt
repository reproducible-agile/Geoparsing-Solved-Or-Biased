Clifton village is now a popular place to live as a consequence of its good transport links and proximity to the railway station at Arlesey. Clifton was voted Bedfordshire Village of the Year in 2003, 2005 and 2009. It is today largely residential, but in the past it was a centre for straw plaiting.
