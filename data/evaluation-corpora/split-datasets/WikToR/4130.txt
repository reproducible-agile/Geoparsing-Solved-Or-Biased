Khanpur (Punjabi خانپور) is a city and Tehsil of the Rahim Yar Khan District of Bahawalpur Division, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The city is a centre for sugarcane and cotton agriculture. It is one of the largest Tehsils of the Rahim Yar Khan District, in terms of its area. The famous Cholistan Desert is mainly located in the Khanpur area. There are many places in Pakistan named Khanpur, but only two of them have the status of Tehsil, and the other one is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khanpur is a strong candidate for becoming a District, as it had the status of District in the British Era until 1938. According to the census of 1998, the city population was 117,764 with an annual growth rate of 2.6%. The majority of the population is Muslim and speaks Majhi and Riasti dialects of the Punjabi language. As of 2009, the recorded population of Khanpur was 156,152. Its old large market areas and Bazaar are clear evidence of the old saga of this city. Its long adjoining Shahi Road leads to many cities such as Rahim Yar Khan on one side and Liaquat Pur and Bahawalpur on the other side. In the old times Khanpur is famous for its bowl makers. Chachran (Sharif) is a small town (a Kasba) located in tehsil Khanpur along with Indus River and approximately 35 km away from Khanpur city is the birthplace of Khawaja Ghulam Fareed (The national poet of saraiki). Only Urban Town of Tehsil Khanpur namely Zahir Pir is situated about 22 kilometres (14 mi) from Khanpur city on National Highway (N-5)(KLP Road), having population of more than 100,000.
