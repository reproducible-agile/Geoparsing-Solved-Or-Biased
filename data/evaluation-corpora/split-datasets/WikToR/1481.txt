Burlington is an agricultural center and town in northwestern Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 152 at the 2010 census. Originally the town of Burlington was named "Drumm", for prominent cattle rancher Major Andrew Drumm. Major Drumm had operated the 150,000 acre U Ranch in the area from 1874 until 1888 on land leased from the Cherokees and was a founder of the Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association. Drumm was also the founder of the Andrew Drumm Institute of Independence Missouri. A post office was established there as such on June 6, 1906. After plans to rename the town "Wheaton" in July of 1907 fell through, the town's name was officially changed to Burlington on August 21, 1907, which it remains to this day. A member-owned ag. coop called Burlington Grain Company was formed in 1916. It is now known as Burlington Cooperative Association. The elevator at Burlington has a capacity of 1,774,000 bushels. A second facility in nearby Amorita has storage space of 342,000 bushels. Alfalfa County’s first consolidated school was organized in Burlington in April of 1908. The following year, the first school building was completed. By 1913, it had 150 students and four teachers. A two story brick building was constructed in 1923. In 1948 a new gymnasium was added. In 1963 a new school was built and many additions have been added since that time – the most recent being a band room and agriculture shop addition in 2014. In the 1960's, Burlington, Driftwood, Byron, and Amorita schools consolidated into a single school.  There were approximately 150 (pre-K-12th) students in 2014.
