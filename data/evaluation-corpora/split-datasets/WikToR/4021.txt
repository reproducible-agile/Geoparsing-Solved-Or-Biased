Penglai (simplified Chinese: 蓬莱; traditional Chinese: 蓬萊; pinyin: Pénglái), is a port, county-level city and an administrative subdivision of the prefecture-level city Yantai in Shandong Province, People's Republic of China, on the northeastern (Bohai Sea) coast of the province. The port was formerly called Dengzhou (Chinese: 登州; pinyin: Dēngzhōu; Wade–Giles: Teng1-chou1). Penglai Water City or Water Fortress (Chinese: 水城; pinyin: Shuíchéng), a fortified harbor hidden from the sea, is one of China's oldest military ports, built in 1376 under the Ming Dynasty and is a protected historical monument. It was "the harbor for the fleet of imperial war junks and town for the semi-imperial garrison."  The Water City is currently being rebuilt at a cost of 500 million yuan (more than 60 million dollars). There is a plank walk along the cliffs nearby. Penglai is the northernmost part of mainland Yantai and located in central Yantai City. Except for the Bohai Sea to the north, Penglai is entirely surrounded by other divisions of Yantai: Fushan District is to the east, Longkou City to the west, and Qixia City to the south. Its limits in geographic coordinates are 37° 25'–37° 50' N, 120° 35'–121° 09' E.
