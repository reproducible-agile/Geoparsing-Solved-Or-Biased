Makin or Makeen is a small town in South Waziristan, Pakistan, located on the Y-junction between Sararogha and Wana, just south of Razmak in North Waziristan. It is mainly populated by members of the Mehsud tribe. The Pakistani military has called it "the nerve center" of the Pakistani Taliban. Just north of Makin is the village of China, and the Taliban stronghold of Ladha is a few kilometers to the south. The Jan Alam Hospital is located in Makin's bazaar. The bazaar is the commercial hub of the Mehsud tribe. As of 2005, tribesmen entering Makin bazaar had to deposit weapons at a checkpoint, to be returned on departure. The Makin Tehsil has seven middle schools (including two for girls) and two high schools (none for girls). Makin was the base of Baitullah Mehsud, the former leader of Tehrik-i-Taliban until his death in an August 2009 drone attack. In 2007, Baitullah Mehsud was at "Anwar Shahâ€™s house" in Makin when he allegedly claimed responsibility for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto during an intercepted phone call.
