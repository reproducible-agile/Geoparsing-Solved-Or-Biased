Glasgow is a city in Chariton and Howard counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. The population was 1,103 at the 2010 census. The Howard County portion of Glasgow is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. Glasgow was laid out and platted in 1836, partially from land acquired from former Missouri State Treasurer James Earickson It was named for James Glasgow, a local merchant. The Battle of Glasgow was fought on October 15, 1864, in and near Glasgow as part of Price's Missouri Expedition during the American Civil War. Although the battle resulted in a Confederate victory and the capture of significant war material, it had little long-term benefit as Price was ultimately defeated at Westport a week later, bringing his campaign in Missouri to an end. On January 20, 1891, an African American man, Olli Truxton, was killed by a white lynch mob in Glasgow. Glasgow is mentioned in the novel Boone's Lick by Larry McMurtry. The Cecil family stops journeys from Boone's Lick by wagon to meet a flatboat at Glasgow that will take them upriver.
