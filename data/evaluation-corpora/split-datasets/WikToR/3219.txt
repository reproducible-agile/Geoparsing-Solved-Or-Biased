Wilton is a town in Fairfield County in southwestern Connecticut in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 18,062. Officially recognized as a parish in 1726, Wilton is today, like many other Fairfield County towns, an expensive residential community with open lands (a testament to its colonial farming roots), historic architecture and extensive town services. Residents commonly commute to New York City, Stamford, and Norwalk, although there are a number of office buildings in town. Wilton was rated one of CNN's top 25 towns to live, boasting an average household income of over $300,000 per family. Wilton is home to many successful start-up companies, national strategy and professional services and consulting firms, and global corporations such as Deloitte & Touche, Sun Products, Breitling USA, Cannondale Bicycle Corporation, Melissa & Doug, and the Blue Buffalo Company (#1 natural pet food manufacturer, also founded here). Many Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered within a 30-minute train or car commute. AIG Financial Products was headquartered in the town. Its trading in credit derivatives essentially bankrupted its parent company, AIG, and helped create the global financial crisis of 2008â€“2009.
