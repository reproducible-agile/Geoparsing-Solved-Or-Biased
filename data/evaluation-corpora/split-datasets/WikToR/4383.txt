The area around Roda was settled during the time of Ranjit Singh in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The village was settled after complete destruction of a village called Moza Joyia. There was fighting around Sahiwal, Jhang and other areas between Ranjit Singh and Rae Ahmed Khan Kharal and Moza Joyia was destroyed. This happened when Ranjit Singh marched in the area in 1821. The name Roda was assigned to it in Revenue Settlement of 1860. In Punjabi language roda means bald. Since the place was almost absolutely bereft of trees looking like a bald land, therefore, it was named as Roda. Roda is home to 39 castes and clans. Both men and women wear the traditional shalwar kameez. Popular sports in Roda include thobi ball (volleyball), cricket, and kabadi. Roda's geography is mixture of flat land and desert sand dunes.
