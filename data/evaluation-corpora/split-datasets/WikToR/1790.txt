Franklin County is a county located in the U.S. state of Arkansas. As of the 2010 census, the population was 18,125. The county has two county seats, Charleston and Ozark. The county was formed on December 19, 1837, and named for Benjamin Franklin, American statesman. To the north of the Arkansas River, which bisects Franklin County, the county is wet and alcohol is sold in liquor stores, bars and local vineyards. To the south of the Arkansas River, the county is dry. Franklin County was carved out of Crawford County in December 1837. At that time, Franklin was significantly larger than it is at present, encompassing part of present-day Logan County which was formed in 1871. Initially, the county had a single courthouse at Ozark. Later, after complaints about how difficult it was to cross the river at times, a second courthouse was established at Charleston, sometime in the 1890s. The reality television show, The Simple Life, starring Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton was filmed in Altus in 2003. Townships in Arkansas are the divisions of a county. Each township includes unincorporated areas; some may have incorporated cities or towns within part of their boundaries. Arkansas townships have limited purposes in modern times. However, the United States Census does list Arkansas population based on townships (sometimes referred to as "county subdivisions" or "minor civil divisions"). Townships are also of value for historical purposes in terms of genealogical research. Each town or city is within one or more townships in an Arkansas county based on census maps and publications. The townships of Franklin County are listed below; listed in parentheses are the cities, towns, and/or census-designated places that are fully or partially inside the township.
