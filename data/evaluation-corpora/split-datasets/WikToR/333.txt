Clifton is a suburb of York in the unitary authority of the City of York, in the north of England about 1Â½ miles from the city centre. The A19, passes north out of York through Clifton. The old village area was made a Conservation Area in 1968. It is the location of Nestle Foods Factory and the Public Schools of St Peter's and the former Queen Anne's. The origin of the name is derived from the Olde English pre-7th century clif, meaning a gentle slope, or more usually a riverbank, with tun, an enclosure or settlement. During Roman times there was a road through Clifton that approached the Roman fortress from the north-west and headed towards the river crossing. There was a second road that also left the north-west gate and may eventually have joined the other. The evidence from early timber buildings from the Museum gardens and early burials from Bootham and Clifton suggest the roads existed from the 1st century. Sporadic 2nd century Roman occupation material and fragments of streets indicate that by that time expansion may have begun in Clifton. This development was not sustained and evidence indicates that from the 3rd century onwards the area beyond St. Mary's was given over to cemeteries.
