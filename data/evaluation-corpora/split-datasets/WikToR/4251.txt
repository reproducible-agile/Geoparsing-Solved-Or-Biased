Magong City (Chinese: 馬公市) is the county seat of Penghu County, Republic of China (Taiwan). Magong is on the western part of the main Penghu Island. The earliest temple in the country to the goddess Matsu is found on Magong. Magong is therefore also known as "Magong Ao" (馬宮澳 or originally, 媽宮澳), or "Matsu Palace Seaport". The first character of the name was changed from "mother" (媽, mā) to "horse" (馬, mǎ) in 1920 under Japanese rule. Known as Makō in Japanese, the area was a major base for the Imperial Japanese Navy and embarkation point for the invasion of the Philippines. On 25 December 1981, Makung was upgraded from an urban township to be a county-controlled city. In January 2009, Taiwan adopted the usage of Hanyu Pinyin to replace Tongyong Pinyin, hence the use of "Magong". Magong City contains 33 municipal villages (里 li): (Romanizations are in Hanyu Pinyin) Fuxing (復興里) Chang'an (長安里)
