Jerusalem is a town in Yates County, New York in the United States. The population was 4,469 at the 2010 census. The town is named after the ancient city of Jerusalem. The Town of Jerusalem is on the south border of the county and is southwest of Geneva, New York. Jerusalem was within the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. It was first settled around 1791.
