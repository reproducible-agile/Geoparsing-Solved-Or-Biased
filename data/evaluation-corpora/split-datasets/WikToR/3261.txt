Smithfield is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Smithfield is located 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of the City of Fairfield and the City of Holroyd. The suburb is in the Greater Western Sydney region. Smithfield's altitude ranges from 21 to 48 m (69 to 157 ft) above sea level (towards the west, around Brenan Park, are the relatively highly elevated places). Geologically, the suburb sits on the Cumberland Plain. The suburb is a mix of residential, industrial and commercial areas, but is mostly characterized by low-density housing. Smithfield was the location for the SBS TV show Housos, being one of the many locations for that TV show. Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal tribe, a sub-group of the Gandangara tribe, have lived in the Fairfield area for over 30,000 years. European settlement began in the area in the early 19th century. Smithfield was originally known as Chilsholm's Bush. In 1867, Smithfield was a semi-rural settlement populated by vine growers, gardeners, wood timber cutters, orchards and tanneries. Early settlers were attracted to Smithfield by its good soil, dependable water supply and easy access to the Colony's established towns. Some of the best farming land was in the district to the west and southwest of the Smithfield area.
