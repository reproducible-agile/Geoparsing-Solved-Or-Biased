Denton is a hamlet in Cambridgeshire, England.  Denton lies approximately 11 miles (18 km) north-west of Huntingdon. Denton is in the civil parish of Denton and Caldecote. Denton is situated within Huntingdonshire which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire as well as being a historic county of England. Denton has approximately 12 houses. All Saints Church in Denton, substantially rebuilt 1629-1671, but with 12th and 13th century elements, was abandoned in the early 1960s and is currently in a ruinous state. However, the roofless church and tower remain grade II listed and occasional services and events are held within. In 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in 1086 and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value.
