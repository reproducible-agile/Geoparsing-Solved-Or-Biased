Calhoun County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,089, making it the third-least populous county in Illinois. Its county seat is Hardin. Calhoun County is located at the tip of the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers and is almost completely surrounded by water. Often referred to as 'The Island,' Calhoun County is sparsely populated; it has just five municipalities, all of them classified as villages. Calhoun County is part of the Metro-East portion of the St. Louis, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. The territory was originally settled by indigenous people who occupied the resource-rich river valleys near waterways. The remains of their occupation have provided some of the most valuable archaeological information in the country. The county's archaeological record chronicles more than 10,000 years of continuous human settlement by Native Americans. Calhoun County was settled by European Americans during the 19th century, and officially organized in 1825. It was named for Vice President John C. Calhoun. The southern side of the county, covered in thick forest, was untouched until the population began to expand in the late 1840s with the arrival of German immigrants. Land was cleared for farming, exporting lumber, and constructing spacious log barns, typically 200 square feet (19 m2) in size, which were a "trademark of successful German farmers."
