Marki consists of three parts: Marki proper, Pustelnik, and Struga. Each part of the town has its own post office, with an assigned zip code. Marki has been long associated with industry, and while manufacturing still takes place, the service sector is booming. Marki has an extensive public education system served with six elementary schools, two preschools, and high school/trade school. While there is currently no hospital, there are a few public and private clinics available to the residents of the town. Marki is surrounded by forests, and pastures. Tourist attractions include numerous man-made ponds, lakes, and hiking trails. Marki is home to two hotels, one in Marki and one in Struga. North-east of Marki, there is a 100-metre high mast used for radio relay links by Telekomunikacja Polska and Centertel.
