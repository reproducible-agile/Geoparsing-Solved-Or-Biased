Exeter is a north-western suburb of Adelaide 14 km from the CBD, on the LeFevre Peninsula, in the state of South Australia, Australia and falls under the City of Port Adelaide Enfield. It is adjacent to Semaphore, Birkenhead, Largs Bay and Glanville. C It is bounded to the south by Exmouth Road, to the north by Hargrave Street and in the east and west by the Outer Harbor railway line and Woolnough Road respectively. Exeter is essentially a residential suburb. On 18 May 1850, Phillip Levi purchased the land sections 1104-1107, Hundred of Port Adelaide. By April 1851, section 1106 was owned by John Lapthorne, who had subdivided it sometime before January 1854, however the name of Exeter does not appear on official documents until 1882 when William Wells cut part of section 1106. John Lapthorne sailed to South Australia on the Orissa in 1840. He was born in Exeter, in the English county of Devon, in 1807 and died at Exeter, Adelaide in 1889; the suburb is named after his home town. An early landmark was the Lord Exmouth Hotel, of which William Knapman (1830â€“1908) was in 1859 the first licensee and, at least in part, the builder. The eponym of the hotel, Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth died at Teignmouth, 15 miles (24 km) south of Exeter, England. The association of the suburb's name deepens, as Knapman's wife Charlotte was born in Christow near Exeter, England. Numerous other places have also been given the name Exeter.
