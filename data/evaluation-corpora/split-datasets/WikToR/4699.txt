Grantham is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,985 at the 2010 census. This made Grantham the fastest growing town numerically in Sullivan County between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. (The neighboring town of Springfield grew at a higher percentage rate, due to a smaller overall population.) Incorporated in 1761, Grantham takes its name from Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham, Secretary of State for the Southern Department from March 1754 to October 1755. The families of Howe, Dunbar and Leavitt were all early Grantham settlers. All three families secured lands in Grantham as part of the charter granted to Baron Grantham in 1761, and all three families "have Grantham hills named after them," according to Elmer M. Hunt in New Hampshire Town Names And Whence They Came. "The Leavitts are said to have had at one time fifty children in attendance at the town's school, and over the years no fewer than seventeen teachers." According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 28.1 square miles (72.8 km2), of which 27.2 square miles (70.4 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2) is water, comprising 3.15% of the town. The highest point in town is Grantham Mountain, 2,660 feet (810 m) above sea level, a peak along the ridge of Croydon Mountain, which follows the western edge of the town. Grantham lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed. A major body of water in Grantham is Eastman Pond which serves as a recreational hub of the Eastman Community. In addition Grantham boasts Anderson and Butternut ponds.
