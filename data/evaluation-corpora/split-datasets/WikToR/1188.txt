Milan (/ˈmaɪ.lʌn/) is the second largest city after Humboldt in Gibson County, Tennessee, and the largest entirely within the county. It is home to the Milan Army Ammunition Plant, the West Tennessee Agricultural Museum and several historical sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The city was the first in Tennessee to begin no-till farming and to flouridate its drinking water. The Milan Endowment for Growth in Academics (MEGA) was the first private community financial endowment for public schools in Tennessee. The city was named after Milan, Italy and is a shibboleth. An alternative source for the name comes from an event in the 1850s. A railroad surveyor asked Beverly A. Williamson who owned the land. Williamson replied, "It's my land." Residents of Milan are usually referred to as Milanites. Milan is approximately 100 miles (160 km) Northeast of Memphis and 140 miles (230 km) West of Nashville, at an elevation of 424 feet (129 m) above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.9 square miles (23 km2), all land.
