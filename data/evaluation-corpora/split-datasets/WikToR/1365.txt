Concord is a town in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,072 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated community of Concord is located in the town. The first non-Native American settlers in the region consisted entirely of settlers from New England as well as settlers from Upstate New York whose parents had moved to that region shortly after the American Revolution. These were "Yankee" settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Jefferson County. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ, United Church of Christ and Church of God. When the New England settlers arrived in what is now Concord there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. New Englanders and New England transplants from Upstate New York were the vast majority of Jefferson County's inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. As a result of this heritage Concord, Wisconsin was named after Concord, New Hampshire. On February 1, 1860, Charles Ingalls married Caroline Quiner in Concord. Their daughter was Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the Little House on the Prairie books.
