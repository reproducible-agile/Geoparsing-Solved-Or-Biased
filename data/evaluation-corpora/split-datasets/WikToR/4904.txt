Portal is a village in Burke County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 126 at the 2010 census. Portal was founded in 1893. Portal sits along the Canadian border and is a major port of entry for road and rail traffic. North Portal, Saskatchewan is just over the border north of Portal. It is one of three year-round, 24-hour ports in North Dakota (the others being Dunseith and Pembina). The town is known for its "international" golf course, which has eight holes in Canada and one in the US. Portal is located at 48°59′44″N 102°33′2″W (48.995629, -102.550430). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.56 square miles (1.45 km2), all land. Because Portal is in the Bakken Oil Field region, the cost of living has risen considerably in recent years. A 2015 speech by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official used Portal as an example of an area where the cost of living, combined with limited housing availability, and the distance from medical care and shopping, can make it difficult to attract employees for federal government positions.
