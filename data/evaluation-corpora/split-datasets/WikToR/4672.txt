Bagol is a village located in the Desuri tehsil in the Pali district of Rajasthan, India. It was established by Keshu Das and Bheek Singh. It is located near Sadri town on state highway SH 62 between Ganthi and Magartalav-Kolar, in a valley on the western side of the Aravalli Range. Bagol is easily accessed by road from Jojawar and Khinwara to Desuri. Falna, Rani, Somesar, phulad and Marwar Junction are the nearest railway stations to reach Bagol. Around 1910, Bagol initially was the only Railway station on proposed Udaipurâ€“Fulad Railway line by Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (BB&CI). Unfortunately due to some Government planning the work of extending the railway line via Bagol was stopped. The interesting fact is that the railway building still exists in Bagol which is now under Forest Department. Shri Chintamani Parshvanath Temple in Bagol is one of the special Jain temple famous for its ancient and historical sculpture of Chintamani Parshwanath. The speciality of this murthi (idol) is that if it is closely watched it may appear to be a common statue but this statue includes many such features as not contained by any other idol. The most prominent and obvious variation of the statue is that it is enhanced by stand of Shesh Nag on each of its shoulders. In general an idol includes only one snake placed overhead.
