Salwa (Arabic: سلوى‎) (place of the casuals) is an area in Hawalli Governorate in Kuwait, bordering Rumaithiya to the north and Messila to the south. To the east (across Cooperative Road), it overlooks the Persian Gulf. Divided into twelve blocks, it is a residential area with a population on 40,000 including Kuwaitis, Westerners, British, Egyptians, Asians (Sri Lankens, Nepalies, Philipinas, Indians and Bangalies) and a small minority of Arabs for instance Lebanese. Salwa is one of the only few places in Kuwait for having 2-3 story buildings which gives you a clear view of the City towers that is 15 Kilometers (10 miles) away. Every block will always have a group of shops including grocery stores,a few Starbucks, McDonald's, Doughnut Shops, phone repair shops, salons and much more. Nice thing which you usually can't find in the US is that most of the restaurants, pharmacy's, and even mobile shops deliver in 30–60 minutes to your door. Salwa also has parks, a beach, outdoor gym, Arabic library's and diwanias ديوانيه which is a tent or building in every street which all Kuwaitis meet at every night and enjoy Arab coffee.
