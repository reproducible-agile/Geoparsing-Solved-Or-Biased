With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's built up area which makes San Ildefonso it's northernmost part. Long before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines, the town of San Ildefonso was known as Bulak. The early inhabitants called this town as such because of the abundant "kapok" trees (Bulak in vernacular) growing on the hill where the town proper is now situated. Bulak was then a barrio of San Rafael. There were very few inhabitants numbering only about 3,000. The early inhabitants were people from neighboring towns and provinces that preferred to settle in this place because of the good prospect of agriculture. When the Spaniards came, the name Bulak was changed to Hacienda San Juan de Dios because her 15,500 hectares of grazing and farming grounds were claimed by the friars. The people were told to pay tribute. Proceeds from the rentals were used to finance the operation of the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Manila. The Spanish friars though antagonistic towards the Filipinos, could not help admiring the beauty of the numerous natural scenarios God bestowed on the town. Because of their admiration, they changed the name Hacienda de San Juan de Dios to amore fitting one Hacienda Buenavista, a Spanish word which means beautiful scenery.
