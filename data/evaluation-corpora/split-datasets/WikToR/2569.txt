Taman (Russian: Тамань) is a rural locality (a stanitsa) in Temryuksky District of Krasnodar Krai, Russia, located on the coast of the Taman Bay. Population: 10,027 (2010 Census); 9,297 (2002 Census). Taman occupies the site of the ancient cities of Hermonassa and Tmutarakan. From the end of the 15th century until 1783, this was a site of a Turkish fortress. Before the annexation it was a sanjak subordinate to the elayet of Kaffa. The modern stanitsa was founded by the Zaporozhian Cossacks under Anton Golovaty on August 25, 1792 as the latter's residence and the first garrison of the Black Sea Cossack Host. Until 1849, Taman was officially considered to be a town, even though it had no local government of its own and was governed from the nearby stanitsa of Akhtanizovskaya. In 1849, Taman was re-organized as a stanitsa and established local government of its own. In August 2008, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a government resolution authorizing the development of a major international cargo port several kilometers south of Taman. Currently, a fertilizer terminal is under construction there to link with the ammonia pipeline to Odessa owned by TogliattiAzot.
