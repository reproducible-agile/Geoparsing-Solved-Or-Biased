Manhattan is a city in northeastern Kansas in the United States, located at the junction of the Kansas River and Big Blue River. It is the county seat of Riley County, although it also extends into Pottawatomie County. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 52,281. The city was founded by settlers from the New England Emigrant Aid Company as a Free-State town in the 1850s, during the Bleeding Kansas era. Nicknamed "The Little Apple" as a play on New York City's "Big Apple", Manhattan is today best known as being the home of Kansas State University and has a distinct college town atmosphere. The town was named an All-American City in 1952, becoming the first city in Kansas to win the award. More recently, in 2007 CNN and Money magazine rated Manhattan as one of the ten best places in America to retire young. And in 2011 Forbes rated Manhattan No. 1 for "Best Small Communities for a Business and Career." Manhattan Regional Airport (MHK) is the second-busiest commercial airport in Kansas. Eight miles (13 km) west of the city is Fort Riley, a United States Army post.
