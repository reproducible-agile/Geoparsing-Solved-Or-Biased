York County is a county located in the north-central section of the U.S. state of South Carolina notorious as a hotbed of Klu Klux Klan activity after the Civil War. As of the 2010 census, the population was 226,073. Its county seat is York, South Carolina, and its largest city is Rock Hill. York County is included in the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-Rock Hill SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. With a population of nearly 6,000 at the time of first European contact, the native inhabitants, the Catawba were primarily agriculturalists. Hernando de Soto passed through the area in the 1540s in his search for gold. Several decades later Juan Pardo recorded his observation of a predominant Native American tribe, later confirmed to be the Catawba, in the vicinity of present-day Fort Mill, east of the Catawba River. The Province of South Carolina was founded in 1670. Twelve years later it was divided into three counties. One of these, Craven County, roughly encompassed the northern half of the colony (including the southern half of present-day York County), while the northern portion of York County was considered part of North Carolina.
