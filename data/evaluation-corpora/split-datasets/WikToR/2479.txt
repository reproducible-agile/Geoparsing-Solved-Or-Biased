Baltimore (/ˈbæltᵻmɔːr/; Irish: Dún na Séad) is a village in western County Cork, Ireland. It is the main village in the parish of Rathbarry and the Islands, the southernmost parish in Ireland. It is the main ferry port to Sherkin Island, Cape Clear Island and the eastern side of Roaring Water Bay (Loch Trasna) and Carbery's Hundred Isles. Although the name Baltimore is an anglicisation of the Irish Baile an Tí Mhóir meaning "town of the big house", the Irish-language name for Baltimore is that of the O'Driscoll castle, Dún na Séad or Dunashad ("fort of the jewels"). The recently restored castle is open to the public and overlooks the town. In ancient times, Dunashad was considered a sanctuary for druids and the place name is associated with Bealtaine. Baltimore has a subtropical maritime climate (Köppen climate classification:Cwb) that borders on humid subtropical climate. There are no significant thermal excursions between summer and winter. Baltimore enters history as a seat of one of Ireland's most ancient dynasties, the once mighty Corcu Loígde, former Kings of Tara and Kings of Munster.
