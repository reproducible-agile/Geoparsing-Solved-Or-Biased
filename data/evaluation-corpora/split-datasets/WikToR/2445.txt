Bangi is a small town situated south of the district of Hulu Langat, in Selangor, Malaysia. It is roughly situated between the towns of Kajang (9 km.) and Putrajaya (formerly Prang Besar, 9 km.). The town is surrounded by palm oil estates, most of which were converted to townships over the last 20 years.

Bangi is not to be confused with Bandar Baru Bangi, a larger township founded more recently several kilometres north, near Kajang. There is a main road with shops houses on both side of the road. Behind these shophouses, 30 acres of rubber estates were converted to residential housing, now known as Kampong Aman. A Malaysian Palm Oil Board research station belonging to UKM is also located near to the town. Within 3 km. , there are Seri Putra Bangi, Bukit Mahkota Bangi, Bangi Avenue, Taman Impian and many more. Bangi is linked to the KTM Komuter commuter train services via the Bangi Komuter station.
