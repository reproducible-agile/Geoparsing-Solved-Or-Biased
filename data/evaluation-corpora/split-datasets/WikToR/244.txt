Manga is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) of Montevideo, Uruguay. Manga shares borders with Manga - Toledo Chico to the north and northwest, Villa García - Manga Rural to the east, Piedras Blancas to the south and Casavalle to the southwest. The origin of the name "Manga" is believed it comes from the short name of the word "Mangangá", name which appeared mentioned in 1780, the zone later called "Manga". According to Benito Tesore, expert in Manga's history and its men that subsisted in the zone in the first years of the century. Lot of trenches and strongholds were built, possibly to stop the Portuguese advance (in Artigas' times). Armed with this assumption, it could be why municipal authority gave names as "Trinchera" (Trenches) and "Fortín" (Fort) to two roads of the zone. The first owner of a ranch in Manga was Esteban Artigas (Son of the captain Juan Antonio Artigas), ceded by The Government of Spain. In the Register Aldecoa, from 1772-1773, he's figured as living with his six under-age children in The Manga, then known as "Pago del Arroyo de Sierra" (Zone of the brook of Mountain Range), known by that name because of a neighbour's surname of the zone.
