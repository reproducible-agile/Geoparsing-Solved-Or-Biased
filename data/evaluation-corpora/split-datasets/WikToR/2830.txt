It is 13 km south of Udupi ( a village is famous for its ancient Krishna Temple) and 40 km north of Mangalore ( a port). It is famous for its lighthouse and the three Mariamma temples and a fort built by Tippu Sultan. There is a beach on the shore of the Arabian Sea and a lighthouse. Many films have been shot at this location. Kaup has three Marigudi which attracts devotees from far away places. The sea is much more rougher and intimidating compared to the gentler Malpe beach in Udupi. It is about 15 km from Manipal and is a favorite hangout for students. The beach also sports a shack and a bar with seating in the open sky. Though the sea is mostly calm all year round, there have been isolated cases of drowning in this beach
