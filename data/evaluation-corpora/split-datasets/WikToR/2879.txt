Wamba is a Spanish town and municipality located in the southeast part of the shire of Torozos Montes, in the province of Valladolid . It borders the municipalities of Peñaflor de Hornija, Villanubla, Ciguñuela, Valladolid (for an enclave of the municipality), Castrodeza and Torrelobatón. Notably Wamba is the only municipality in Spain whose name contains the letter w. This town is located on the Camino de Santiago de Madrid. Its name comes from the Gothic King Wamba , who was elected king in that city in the year 672 . At that time it was called Gérticos and King Recceswinth had a villa there resting. As Receswinth died in this town, the nobles elected Wamba immediately that day. Church of Santa Maria is known of the existence of a Visigoth church there, which are preserved remains of decoration in the Archaeological Museum of Valladolid, and it seems likely that during the repopulation of this area there existing church was rebuilt from the times Receswinth and that, by its nature, should be the first Mozarabic church in the area and possibly unlike other nearby places like San Cebrián de Mazote, Wamba was repopulated by people coming from the north and that this is a much closer to the Visigothic and Asturian influences that may contribute to the building Christians who came from Al-Andalus.
