Albany was laid out in about 1832. It was incorporated as a village in 1842. The small rural village became one of several stops in Athens County for the Underground Railroad, as fugitives could come upriver on the Hocking River from the Ohio River. Free blacks, many of whom had migrated from the Upper South, settled the village in the mid-19th century. The black population increased during the 1850s from four in the township to 174 by 1860, largely because of the chance for their children to attend the Albany Manual Labor Academy, which was open to both genders and all races. The outbreak of the Civil War caused the academy to lose students and close.
