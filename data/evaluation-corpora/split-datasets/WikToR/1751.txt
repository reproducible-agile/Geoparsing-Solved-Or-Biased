Jincheng (simplified Chinese: 晋城; traditional Chinese: 晉城; pinyin: Jìnchéng) is a prefecture-level city in the southeast of Shanxi province of north China. It is an industrial city in an area where coal mining is an important industry. The entire prefecture has a population of 2.2 million. The presence of such a large coal industry has given Jincheng a reputation for air pollution and in recent years the local government has invested heavily to promote better air quality in the city. This includes tree-planting, establishing and maintaining large parks and ecological reserves, shutting down or relocating some of the worst-polluting factories, and the generalized use of coalbed methane which burns much cleaner than coal. Jincheng is located in the southeast corner of Shanxi province. The prefecture-level city covens an area of 9,490-square-kilometers. It has 188,920 hectares of cultivated land. Jincheng has considerable mineral resources, notably coal. Coal-beds account for more than 56% of the total area. Most of this is anthracite, a very valuable type of coal with few impurities. The anthracite in Jincheng makes up more than a quarter of the total in China and half of the total for Shanxi province. Jincheng also has a large coalbed methane field which was discovered in Qinshui county in 2001.
