Monterey is a town in Highland County, Virginia, United States. The population was 147 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Highland County. The selection of Monterey as the county seat of Highland County in 1847 was associated with the blazing of the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike in 1838. The new town was named in commemoration of the Battle of Monterrey, Mexico (September 21–24, 1846) in which General (and future President) Zachary Taylor gained a key victory for the United States in the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). Monterey is a Spanish word meaning "mountain of the king". The GW Jeep Site, Monterey High School, and Monterey Hotel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
