Charleston is a town in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 1,373 at the 2010 census. The town was named for Charles Van Epps, an early settler. The Town of Charleston is on the south border of the county and is southwest of the City of Amsterdam. Charleston is the only town in the county not bordering the Mohawk River. Parts of Charleston were in Corry's Patent (1637), Stone Heap Patent (1770), and Thomas Machin's Patent (1787). Settlers began arriving before the American Revolution. The Town of Charleston was formed by a division of the original "Town of Mohawk" in 1793.
