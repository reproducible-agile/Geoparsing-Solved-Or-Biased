Bergen is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Birkenfeld district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Herrstein, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. In 926, Bergen had its first documentary mention. To the southwest once lay the now vanished village of Staufenberg. After the Second World War, the village still had more than sixty businesses that were active in agriculture. Nowadays there are only seven, most of which are run as sidelines. Until 1969, Bergen still had its own primary school; after it closed that year, schoolchildren were transferred to the nearby town of Kirn in Bad Kreuznach district. In 1995, the Verbandsgemeinde of Herrstein opened a two-group kindergarten with an intake capacity of 50 three- to six-year-olds. This is meant to serve not only Bergen, but also the neighbouring municipalities of Berschweiler, Griebelschied and Sonnschied. Bergen’s mayor is Gerhard Friedt. The municipality’s arms might be described thus: Per bend sable a mount of three per bend argent and Or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure.
