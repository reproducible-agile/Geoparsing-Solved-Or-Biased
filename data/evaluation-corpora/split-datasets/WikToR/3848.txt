Colton is a village and civil parish in Lichfield District, Staffordshire, England. It is situated just outside the town of Rugeley. Colton is the home to Border Collie Trust GB, a registered charity rescuing and rehoming Border Collies and Collie crosses throughout the UK. There is also a village hall and a small church. There is a bypass that has just been built near Rugeley the town nearest Colton. There is also a park for young children. Colton lies just off the B5013, which runs from Rugeley, local pronunciation 'Rudge-Lee' or 'Rewj-uh-lee', to Uttoxeter ('Utch-eater'). The village is entered by way of a hump-back bridge over the Moreton Brook, which has a ford alongside for large vehicles. It is said that in WWII, a US army lorry took the bridge at speed and overturned, killing two soldiers. St. Mary's Church stands on the right, with St. Mary's School on the left. There used to be a pool on the left a short distance beyond the school, on which people would skate, or slide, during the frequent very cold winters of the 1960s. A hundred yards further on is the Forge, where the Williscroft family would with a steel hoop re-tyre your cart wheel, make you a toboggan for use in the snow on The Martlin Hill, or dig your grave, make your coffin and conduct your funeral.
