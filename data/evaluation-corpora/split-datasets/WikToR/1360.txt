Concord is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. Concord is known as the 'Parklands Suburb' of the Inner West. Concord West is a separate suburb, to the north-west. Concord takes its name from Concord, Massachusetts, in the USA, which was the site of the Battle of Concord, one of the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1778). Some historians believe the Sydney suburb was named Concord to encourage a peaceful attitude between soldiers and settlers. The first land grants in the area were made in 1793. The original Concord Council was established in 1883. Concord Council amalgamated with Drummoyne Council in 2000 after 117 years of self governance to form the City of Canada Bay. It is also the name of the surrounding parish. Concord features a small shopping strip on Majors Bay Road. Several cafes and restaurants featuring outside dining are located here.
