Middleton is a city in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. It is a north-western suburb of the state capital, Madison, but it was actually founded before Madison. It got its name from Middletown, Connecticut; the "w" being dropped was due to a paperwork error made by longtime historian Edward Kromrey (namesake of the local middle school). Middleton's motto is "The Good Neighbor City." The population was 17,442 at the 2010 census. In July 2009, CNN/Money and Money magazine ranked Middleton the fourth best small town to live in the United States. Since 1990 there has been a population increase of over 20% in the Madison metropolitan area. This has led to Middleton being considered as the western hub of a proposed, albeit controversial, 13-mile (21 km) railroad corridor connecting Middleton's Greenway Station, the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison campus, downtown Madison, and Madison's far east side. As of the census in 2000, there were 15,770 people living in Middleton, although in 2006 that number was estimated to be as high as 16,595. The population density was 1,953.2 people per square mile (754.5/km2). There were 7,397 housing units at an average density of 916.2 per square mile (353.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 92.08% White, 1.97% Black or African American, 0.45% Native American, 2.66% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.27% from other races, and 1.54% from two or more races. 2.82% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.
