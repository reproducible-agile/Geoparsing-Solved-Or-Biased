Fremont is a city in and the county seat of Sandusky County, Ohio, United States. The population was 16,734 at the 2010 census. It was the home of Rutherford B. Hayes, who served as President of the United States from 1877 to 1881. The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center remains one of the focal points of Fremont, OH. The National Arbor Day Foundation designated Fremont as a Tree City USA. The area which is now Fremont was originally a Wyandot village. In the 1750s a French trading post was established there. In 1787 the United States established the Northwest Territory, and in 1803 the southeastern portion of the Territory was admitted to the Union as part of the new state of Ohio. During the early and mid 1800s a few Europeans and African Americans, predominantly runaway slaves, settled in the area, which became known as Lower Sandusky for its location on the Sandusky River. Under the terms of Ohio's admission, Lower Sandusky was defined as Indian Territory, so the non-Wyandot settlements were in direct violation of the Treaty of Greeneville; at one point the United States Army considered removing the settlers by force, but did not carry out the threat. Fort Stephenson was built there during the War of 1812, and the Battle of Fort Stephenson was fought there in August 1813.
