San Juan is a city in the Philippines. It is one of the cities that comprises Metro Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. It is the smallest city in the country in terms of land area. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 121,430. San Juan was the site of the first battle of the Katipunan, the organization which led the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire. "San Juan City" is a contraction of the city's longer, ceremonial name of San Juan del Monte (English: "Saint John of the Mountain"). As with numerous other places in the Philippines, the city's name combines a patron saint and a toponym; in this case, the place is named for Saint John the Baptist and its hilly, relatively high elevation compared to surrounding areas. The city's official name is Dakilang Lungs√≥d ng San Juan (Tagalog, "Great City of San Juan"). San Juan is bounded by Quezon City on the north and east, Mandaluyong on the south, and the City of Manila in the west.
