Tondo is a district located in Manila, Philippines. It is the largest in terms of area and population of Manila's sixteen districts, with a Census-estimated 628,106 people in 2010 and consists of two congressional districts. It is also the most densely populated district in the city. Today, if it were an independent city, Tondo would rank as the tenth most populous city in the Philippines, behind only the other districts of the City of Manila combined, and the cities of Quezon, Caloocan, Davao, Cebu, Zamboanga, Taguig, Antipolo and Pasig. Tondo hosts the country's largest ports, the Manila North Harbour and the Manila International Container Terminal. According to Laguna Copperplate Inscription, Tondo has existed since 900 AD, and has been ruled by Jayadeva who holds the Sanskrit title Senapati or "admiral". Numerous theories on the origin of the name "Tondo" have been put forward. Philippine National Artist Nick Joaquin suggested that it might be a reference to high ground ("tundok"). French linguist Jean-Paul Potet, however, has suggested that the River Mangrove, Aegiceras corniculatum, which at the time was called "tundok" ("tinduk-tindukan" today), is the most likely origin of the name.
