Hastings is a suburb of Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia, as a part of the urban enclave on Western Port comprising Hastings, Bittern, Crib Point, Tyabb, and Somerville. Its local government area is the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. It is served by Hastings railway station on the Stony Point greater-metropolitan line. Hastings is situated on an inlet on Western Port, a major port and important environmental area. Hastings has multiple marinas and is home to many recreational boating activities. Hastings is thought to be named after a fishing town in England or the British imperial administrator Warren Hastings. Previously known as Kingâ€™s Creek and Star Point, its post office opened on 4 February 1863. Settlement of the area dates from the 1840s, with fishing being the main industry. Growth took place from the 1850s into the 1870s as the township developed. Expansion continued in the late 1880s and 1890s, aided by the construction of the railway line and the establishment of many orchards. Significant residential development occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by industrial growth and public housing construction. Growth began to slow from the 1980s. The population has increased since the early 1990s, a result of new dwellings being added to the area.
