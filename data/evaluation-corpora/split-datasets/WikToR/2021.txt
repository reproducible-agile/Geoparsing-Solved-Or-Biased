Burton is a small village with 103 households (2014) in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England. Kelly's Directory of Wiltshire of 1915 identifies Burton as the most important part of the parish of Nettleton. It is about 8 miles (13 km) west of Chippenham. There is a record of Burton dating back to AD 1204, and more recently in Book 44 - Wiltshire, of the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey 1659-70. The modern community has an active Anglican church, St Mary's; the Burton Community Association, formed in 2014; and a public house, The Old House at Home. It is served by two nearby Church schools, Bybrook Valley CofE School in Yatton Keynell (4 miles) and Trinity CofE School in Acton Turville (1 mile), as well as Grittleton House private school (3 miles). The Church of St Mary the Virgin, which stands on the hill above the hamlet of Burton, is the oldest and most important building in the village, and is a Grade I listed building. The oldest parts of the Church date from about 1290 although little remains from that period. The Register of Incumbents dates back to 1305 when the Abbot of Glastonbury presented Johannes de Montacute to the living. The Manor and Advowson of Netlington belonged, until the Dissolution, to Glastonbury Abbey. The Church is now in the ByBrook Benefice in the rural deanery of Chippenham, archdeaconry of Malmesbury, and the present patron is the Bishop of Bristol.
