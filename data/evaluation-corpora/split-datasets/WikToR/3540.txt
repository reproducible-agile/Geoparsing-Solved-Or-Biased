Wilmington is a town in the Yorke and Mid North region of South Australia. The town is located in the District Council of Mount Remarkable local government area, 305 kilometres (190 mi) north of the state capital, Adelaide. At the 2006 census, Wilmington had a population of 220. Originally named "Beautiful Valley", Wilmington is a farming community, known for sheep, wheat and barley, but more recently the temperature conditions and rainfall have contributed to the increasing popularity of the planting of olive groves. The town has a post office, hotel, two caravan parks, take-away shop, two service stations, primary school, kindergarten, museum and op shop. It borders the Mount Remarkable National Park and the beautiful Alligator Gorge is a 10-minute drive from Wilmington. Wilmington is a popular place to stay due to its proximity to the tourist areas of the Flinders Ranges, most notably Wilpena Pound. Wilmington was established as a stop over route for grain and wool being delivered by horse and cart from Port Augusta on its way to Adelaide. The historic Wilmington Coaching Stables on Fourth Street survive and are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.
