Douglas County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2010 census, the population was 517,110. It is the state's most populous county, home to over one-fourth of Nebraska's residents. Its county seat is Omaha, the state's largest city. The county was established in 1854 and named after Stephen A. Douglas (1813â€“1861), U.S. Senator from Illinois. Douglas County is included in the Omaha-Council Bluffs, NE-IA Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the Nebraska license plate system, Douglas County was represented by the prefix "1" (as it had the largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922). In 2002, the state discontinued the 1922 system in the three most populous counties: Douglas, Sarpy, and Lancaster counties. Douglas County is governed by a board of seven county commissioners, elected to four year terms. County courthouse positions are also elected on a partisan basis. Most of the county's offices are located at the Douglas County Courthouse. Ackerhurst Dairy Barn
