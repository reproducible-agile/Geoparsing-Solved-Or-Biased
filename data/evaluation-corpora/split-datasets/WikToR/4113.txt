Andrade (formerly, Cantu) is a small unincorporated community in the southeasternmost corner of the state of California, in Imperial County. The community is located entirely within the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. It is directly across the border from Los Algodones, the northernmost town of the municipality of Mexicali, in Baja California, and in all of Mexico. The ZIP Code is 92283. The community is inside area code 760. Pilot Knob Station served as a stop on the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and Butterfield Overland Stage line and its successors until the railroad arrived in 1877. The Pilot Knob Station was located at what is now Andrade, near the bank of the Colorado River at the foot of Pilot Knob, for which it was named. Andrade is named after Mexican General Guillermo Andrade. The General sold the land for the settlement to the California Development Company. The town was named in 1912 with establishment of the post office. A post office operated at Andrade from 1909 to 1910 and from 1912 to 1942. The name Cantu commemorated Col. Esteban Cantu, governor of the northernmost district of Baja California from 1915 to 1920.
