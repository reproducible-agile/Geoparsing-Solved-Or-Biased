Summit is an unincorporated community in Boyd County, Kentucky, United Stateson US 60 just west of Ashland. Summit is often considered a section of Ashland because it shares the city's ZIP code. However, it is entirely located outside Ashland's corporation limits and is a nearby suburb. The spelling of Summit officially has only one "T" at the end but is often spelled with two "T's" and both are accepted as correct. Summit is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. Summit's name reflects its location on relatively flat terrain at a higher elevation than other parts of the surrounding area. Unusual for the region, this terrain was created by the ancient Teay's River and the associated Glacial Lake Tight. In the 1940s, Summit began transforming from a sparsely populated farming community into a populated suburban area, partly due to the construction of Federal Correctional Institution located there on Kentucky Route 716, and the upgrading of U.S. Route 60, which made eased communications with Ashland.
