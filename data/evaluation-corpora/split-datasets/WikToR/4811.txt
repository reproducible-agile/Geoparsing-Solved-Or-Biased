Middleton is a town in South Australia on the eastern end of the south coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula. It is situated between the towns of Port Elliot and Goolwa. At the 2006 census, Middleton had a population of 818. Middleton is a holiday and tourist destination with a popular surf beach. Some southern right whales calve and mate in the waters off Middleton's beaches and can be viewed from Middleton Point or Bashams Beach during the whale watching season (June or July to October). Australian sea lions can be seen resting on beaches. Middleton has many holiday homes and a caravan park. It also has two doctors' surgeries, a pharmacy, a surf school, general store, hotel, bakery, hairdresser, antique shop, manufacturing jeweller, beautician and a high quality restaurant. It has two playgrounds, tennis courts and an art and craft centre. The land on which the original homes of Middleton stand was purchased by Lt Col Thomas Higgins in 1849 who named the town after a Middleton in Ireland. The original inhabitants of the area were the Ngarrindjeri people and at least three burial sites are said to be situated around the town, one of which has been built over by a commercial entity. A thorough history of Middleton since white settlement, written by Peter Humby is available from the art and craft centre in the main street.
