Mora or Santa Gertrudis de lo de Mora is a census-designated place in, and the county seat of, Mora County, New Mexico, United States. It is located about half way between Las Vegas, New Mexico and Taos on Highway 518 at an altitude of 7,180 feet. The Battle of Mora and the Second Battle of Mora were fought in Mora in 1847, where US troops eventually defeated the insurgents, effectively ending the Taos Revolt in the Mora Valley. Hispanic settlers had occupied lands within the Mora Valley without legal title ever since Governor de Anza had made peace with the Comanches in the late 18th century opening up the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains for settlement. However, Mora was formally founded as a farming community in 1835 The settlers came primarily from Las Trampas, but also from Picuris and Embudo. The 76 families each received a strip of land by grant of Governor Albino Perez. Despite fanciful stories about fur trappers, scattered bones and subsistence on mulberries (mora means mulberry in Spanish), the fact is that the valley, the river and the town took their name from the family name "Mora" of several of the settler families.
