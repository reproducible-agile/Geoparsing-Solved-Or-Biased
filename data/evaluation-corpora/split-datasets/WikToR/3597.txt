Bukovo (pronounced [ˈbuːkɔʋɔ]) is a settlement in the Municipality of Cerkno in the traditional Littoral region of Slovenia. Bukovo is a scattered village along the southwest slope of Mount Kojca (1,303 meters or 4,275 feet) on the saddle between the valleys of the Bača and Idrijca rivers. It also includes several hamlets southeast of the village center: Krtečne, Kojca, Selc, Žabže (or Žabče), and Laharn (from north to south). The soil is sandy and marly. The tilled fields lie on steep slopes, which traditionally necessitated carrying the last furrow plowed to the top of the slope by hand, or using oxen or a block-and-tackle system. Kojca is the oldest of the hamlets comprising Bukovo. In 1652 it was mentioned as the seat of a district that also included Bukovo, Krtečne, Žabže, and Selc. Most of the hamlet of Selc burned in 1935 because of a lightning strike. During the Second World War, German forces burned two houses and a hayrack in Bukovo and looted the village on November 1, 1943. The hamlet of Žabže was burned on June 10, 1944; during the attack, three men were killed and four women burned to death.
