Commodore Abraham Whipple was given a grant to the town, along with 50-60 of his shipmates. He called it "Navy." Abner Allen, from Barton, Vermont, was the first settler in 1803. In 1825, the town changed its name to Charleston, presumably after a naval battle that had occurred off Charleston, South Carolina.
