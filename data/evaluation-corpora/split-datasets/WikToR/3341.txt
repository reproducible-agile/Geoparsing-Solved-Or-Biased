Milford is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. It is located across the Penobscot River from the city of Old Town. The population of Milford was 3,070 at the 2010 census. The town's slogan is the "Best little town by a dam site," referring to the Milford Dam abutting Milford on the Penobscot River, south of the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. Milford was the site of a major 19th century water powered sawmill on the Penobscot River. Most of its lumber was shipped from nearby Bangor. The large Bodwell Water Power Co. sawmills (1889), owned by Maine Governor Joseph Robinson Bodwell, burned in 1891, almost taking the village with it. The present Bodwell Water Power Co. plant, also known as the Milford Plant of Bangor Hydro, was built in 1906 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by Wallace C. Johnson, a civil engineer who also worked on hydro-power projects at Niagara Falls. The Milford Congregational Church, designed and built by Asa T. Wing, is also listed on the National Register.
