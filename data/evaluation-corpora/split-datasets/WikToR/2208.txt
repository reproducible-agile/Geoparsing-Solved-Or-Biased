Bolivar is an unincorporated community in northern Denton County, Texas, United States, at the intersection of Farm Roads 2450 and 455, 14 miles northwest of Denton, on Clear Creek. The community was founded as New Prospect in 1859. William Crawford sold the site to Hiram Daily, a Methodist minister and doctor, who opened a general store, and laid out and named the town. In 1861 Ben Brown, a farmer who had moved from Bolivar, Tennessee, suggested the renaming of the town and persuaded residents to vote for the name Bolivar (pronounced by locals as "BALL-iver") by providing them free rum. John Simpson Chisum ranched near Bolivar but moved his herds in 1863 to West Texas. Bolivar was three miles east of the Chisholm Trail, which ran through nearby cattle ranches. Cowboys on the trail came to Bolivar to stay at its hotel and patronize its saloons. Development of the community was slow but steady until 1886. In that year, Bolivar merchants moved their businesses to Sanger, on the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railwayâ€”locals say Bolivar residents opposed giving up land for the railroad, whereas nearby Sanger, Texas to the east was much more accommodating.
