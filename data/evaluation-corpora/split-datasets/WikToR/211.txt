Boston (/ˈbɒstən/) is a town and small port in Lincolnshire, on the east coast of England. It is the largest town of the wider Borough of Boston local government district. The borough had a total population of 64,637 at the 2011 census, whilst the town itself had a population of 35,124 at the 2001 census. It is due north of Greenwich on the Prime Meridian. Boston's most notable landmark is St Botolph's Church ("The Stump"), said to be the largest parish church in England, with one of the taller towers in England visible for miles around from the flat lands of Lincolnshire. Residents of Boston are known as Bostonians. Emigrants from Boston named several other settlements after the town, most notably Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States. The name "Boston" is commonly said to be a contraction of "Saint Botolph's town", "stone", or "tun" (Old English for a hamlet or farm). The town's direct link to the saint is probably apocryphal, but the name may have arisen from confusion as to the site of his monastery or owing to his patronage of the parish church.
