Inglewood is a small town near Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the Adelaide Hills Council local government area, and is adjacent to Houghton, Paracombe and the rural districts of Upper Hermitage and Chain Of Ponds. At the 2006 census, Inglewood had a population of 264. Inglewood was named after a town in Cumberland, England. Houghton already existed along an earlier road, and its people banked on the new main line of road supporting their future. They were, to put it mildly, upset to discover that the new road would bypass Houghton, taking a course considered to be 'more advantageous' to travellers. Out of this came Inglewood, initially as an hotel constructed in 1858 at the hands of Firman Deacon, who could see advantage in the midst of Houghton's adversity. When the hotel was close to completion, Deacon offered his builders five gallons of beer to provide a suitable name for it. Overnight the men, deliberated, finally agreeing on Inglewood, a name emanating from the north of England. By the time Deacon arrived the next day the name Inglewood Inn had been painted on a board opposite the bar. Some settlers, a store or two and the like came on the scene and that is as large as Inglewood grew. Today the historic inn is still its focal point, with one or two supporting businesses - a bakery, post office, hairdresser, alpaca stud, crash repairer, various orchards and more keeping the little community busy.
