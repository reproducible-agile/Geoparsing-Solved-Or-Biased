Franklin County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,680. The county seat is Hampton. The county was formed on January 15, 1851 and named after Benjamin Franklin. Franklin County is home to the Franklin County Fair. Held annually for five days in mid-July, the Franklin County Fair is held on the fairgrounds located on the west side of Hampton. Traditionally, grandstand entertainment begins on Wednesday with the Barnes PRCA Rodeo. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are usually concerts featuring nationally known entertainment. In 2007 such names as Terri Clark, Marshall Tucker Band, and Trent Tomlinson & Danielle Peck brought fans to the grandstand. On Sunday the Figure 8 Races generally fill the grandstand. The fair also includes free entertainment and a carnival midway. The fairgrounds features the Franklin County Historical Museum, Pleasant Hill (turn of the century village with stores, crafters, old west shows, music and entertainment), and Grandpa's Farm (all phases of farming demonstrated with vintage implements powered by draft horses, steam engines and antique tractors).
