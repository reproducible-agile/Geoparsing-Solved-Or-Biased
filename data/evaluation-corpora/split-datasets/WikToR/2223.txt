Monroe is a city in Benton County, Oregon, United States. The population was 617 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Corvallis, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area. Monroe is located midway between Eugene and Corvallis along highway 99W and the city experiences a strong friendly rivalry between fans of the Oregon Ducks and the Oregon State Beavers. The city formed around a small sawmill established by Joseph White in 1852. By 1853, there was a small settlement known as White's Mill. Around the same time, Roland Hinton formed the town of Starr Point north of White's Mill. In 1857, Starr Point combined with White's Mill to form the town of Monroe. The city quickly became a center for paddle boat traffic. It was one of the largest cities in the state for many years. Monroe High School was built in the 1920s. Since the construction of I-5 in the 1960s, the city has turned into a rural farming community. It is the home of historic Hull-Oakes Lumber Mill, the only steam-powered sawmill operating in the U.S.
