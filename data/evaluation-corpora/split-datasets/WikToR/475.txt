Much of the village is within the limits of the Shimokita Hanto Quasi-National Park. The mountainous area is home to many indigenous plant and animal species.

During the Edo period, it was controlled by the Nambu clan of Morioka Domain and prospered due to its timber industry and as a ferry terminal to Ezo. During the cadastral reform of 1889, Sai Village was proclaimed from the merger of Sai hamlet with neighboring Chōgō hamlet.
