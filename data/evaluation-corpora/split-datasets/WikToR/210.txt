Boston (pronounced /ˈbɒstən/) is the capital of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the largest city in New England. The municipality is the northern anchor of the U.S. northeast megalopolis. New England's largest airport, Logan International Airport, is within the municipal limits. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. The municipality was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Britain, the municipality continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub, as well as a center for culture and education. Through land reclamation and municipal annexation, Boston has expanded beyond its original boundaries. The municipality's history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year. Boston is the site of the first public school in the U.S., Boston Latin School, and the first rapid transit system, the Tremont Street Subway. Apart from higher education and sports, Boston's diverse economy includes biotechnology, finance, government activities, information technology and professional services. Households in the municipality claim the highest average rate of philanthropy in the U.S. and businesses and institutions rank amongst the top in the country for environmental sustainability and investment. Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the U.S., though it remains high on world livability rankings.
