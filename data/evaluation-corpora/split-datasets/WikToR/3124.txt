Formosa is a municipality located in the state of Goiás, Brazil, approximately 80 kilometers east of Brasília. The population was 90,247 (2007) in a total area of 5,806.89 km2 (10-10-2002). Formosa is known for its waterfalls and natural beauty. It is a large producer of cattle and grains and is one of the fastest growing cities in the state. Arraial dos Couros was the first name of Formosa, which was founded in the second half of the eighteenth century on an uncertain date. For lack of documentation the early history is fragmented and historians can only speculate about the real facts. What is known is that problems connected to the area of health were the motive for the transfer of the old settlement which was founded and built by black slaves, located on the banks of the Itiquira River and the Paranã in the tropical Paranã valley. At the time a devastating fever swept the place, probably caused by the unhealthy climate of the river location, and the population was afflicted by a degenerative malaria. For fear of getting the disease the move was made very quickly.
