Hillsboro is a city in and the county seat of Hill County in Central Texas. The population was 8,456 at the 2010 census. Hillsboro, located on Interstate 35 where I-35E and I-35W split south of the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex, is the primary center for trade and commerce in Hill County. It is located almost midway between the Metroplex and Waco, and is the gateway to the popular Lake Whitney. There are many antique stores located downtown, and a popular outlet mall is located along the Interstate, surrounded by numerous hotels and motels. The city is known for its abundance of restored Victorian homes and its historic county courthouse, which on January 1, 1993 was heavily damaged by an electrical fire. It was rebuilt, courtesy of donations from around the world and two concerts sponsored by Hill County native Willie Nelson. The courthouse (See Hill County, Texas for photograph.) won the Downtown Association's 1999 award for "Best Restoration". The renovation sparked an interest in restoring Texas's historic courthouses. The Hill County courthouse is eight miles from Willie Nelson's hometown, Abbott.
