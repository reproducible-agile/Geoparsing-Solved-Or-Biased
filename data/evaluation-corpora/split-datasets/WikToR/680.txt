Alma is a city in and the county seat of Wabaunsee County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 832. For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1859, Wabaunsee County was founded. The first house was built at Alma in 1867. In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Topeka through Alma to Herington. The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980. This line of the former Rock Island Railroad was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad and later merged into the Union Pacific that operates and owns the line today. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "Rock Island". The city was named after either the city of Alma, Germany, or for a stream in the Ukraine.
