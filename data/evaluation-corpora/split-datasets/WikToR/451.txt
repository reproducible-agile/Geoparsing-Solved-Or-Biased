Sula  is a municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is part of the Sunnmøre district. The administrative centre is the village of Langevåg. Other villages include Solevåg, Fiskarstrand, Veibust, Leirvågen, and Mauseidvågen. Sula is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Møre og Romsdal county, and it is part of the Ålesund Region since it is just south of the city of Ålesund. The municipality encompasses the island of Sula and the many small surrounding islets. Originally, most of the island of Sula was part of the old Borgund Municipality and the small southwestern part of the island was part of Ulstein Municipality (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 July 1958, the southwestern part of Sula island was transferred to Borgund Municipality. In 1968, Borgund Municipality (including all of the island of Sula) was merged with the town of Ålesund to form the large Ålesund Municipality. On 1 January 1977, the entire island of Sula and the many small islets around it were separated from Ålesund Municipality to become a separate municipality. The initial population of the new Sula Municipality was 6,302.
