Compton is a former village and today a semi-rural suburb centred 1 mile (1.6 km) ESE of Farnham in the Waverley district of Surrey, England and connected to Farnham by two direct urban single carriageways and green space footpaths along the Wey (North Branch) which in part marks the northern boundary of the area together with the A31. The area relies on Farnham for most of its modern amenities and its eastern part is rural whereas its western part is urban, with a divide where the Wey flows between the two south-eastwards. Compton has given its name to the local roads Compton Way and Old Compton Lane, and is most formally, though on few modern maps, considered to include (being a medieval-founded tything and manor) Moor Park, Farnham on the left bank of the Wey, further east. Moor Park takes its recent name from Moor Park House the former mansion of Sir William Temple, where Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels lived and worked which is a listed building in the mid category, Grade II*. The house dates from 1307 when it was Compton Hall. Compton Woods is an area of woodland with public access.
