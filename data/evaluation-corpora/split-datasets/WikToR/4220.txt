Pirita occupies a relatively big area, but compared to other districts of Tallinn its population of 16,636 (as of1 Jan 2012) is relatively small. It mostly consists of private houses, instead of the large blocks of flats typical of some other districts of Tallinn, such as Lasnamäe and Mustamäe. Large parts of the district consist of newly built, modern buildings and houses. Pirita beach is located in Pirita.
