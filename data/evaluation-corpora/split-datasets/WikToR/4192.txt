Dundee /ˈdʌndiː/ is a city in Yamhill County, Oregon, United States. The population was 3,162 at the 2010 census. The first post office in the area was Ekins, established in 1881. Dundee is named in honor of the birthplace of William Reid, Dundee, Scotland. Reid came to Oregon in 1874 to establish the Oregonian Railway, and made several extensions to the railroad in the western Willamette Valley. The Ekins post office was closed in 1885 and a new office opened in 1887, named "Dundee Junction". The name derived from plans to build a bridge across the Willamette River for the railroad, which would have called for a junction at Dundee between the west railroad and the new east railroad. The bridge was never built, however, and the post office was renamed "Dundee" in 1897. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.35 square miles (3.50 km2), of which, 1.33 square miles (3.44 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water.
