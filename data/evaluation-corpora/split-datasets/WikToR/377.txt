The Town of Limon is the Statutory Town that is the most populous municipality in Lincoln County, Colorado, United States. Limon is located immediately east of Elbert County. The population was 1880 at the 2010 United States Census. Limon has been called the "Hub City" of Eastern Colorado because Interstate 70, U.S. Highways 24, 40, and 287, and State Highways 71 and 86 all pass through the town. The Limon Correctional Facility is part of the Colorado Department of Corrections system and is a major employer in the area with employment of roughly 350. Limon is listed as the official AASHTO control city for signs on Interstate 70 between Denver and Hays, Kansas, although westbound signs in both Colorado and Kansas often omit Limon and list the larger city of Denver. Limon is the western terminus of the Kyle Railroad and it is here the shortline interchanges with the Union Pacific Railroad. Trains previously stopped at Limon Railroad Depot. The town was named for John Limon, meaning lemon in Spanish, a railroad construction supervisor. Limon was the site of one of the most gruesome lynchings in American history on November 16, 1900. Preston Porter Jr, who had confessed to the murder of a white girl, was led by rope through town, and then tied to a stake and burned to death. He screamed out to be shot, but onlookers only heaped on more fuel, according to an article in the November 17, 1900, edition of The New York Times.
