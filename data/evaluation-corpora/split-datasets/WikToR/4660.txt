Bangar is a third class municipality in the province of La Union, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 34,522 people. The name Bangar (pronounced: Bang-gar) is derived from the bangar tree (pronounced ba- ngar; Sterculia foetida), which were once abundant in the general area of the present town. The bangar is notable for the foul odour that emanates from its flowers. Agdeppa - Notorious criminals were once often executed with their arms outstretched, and the place was thus called agdeppa, meaning outstretched arms. Alzate - named after a Spanish colonial officer called General Alzate, who manned the garrison in that place against the local revolucionarios. It is said that the Amburayan River which partly flowed through Bangar was a favourite swimming hole for Spaniards and the early illustrados. Bangaoilan - Once called "Anonang", the town was renamed because of the abundance of a poisonous plant called bangaoil. Barraca - This barrio was formed from the two sitio of Binyadura and Nagpalcan. Barraca was adopted as the common name after residents of both hamlets signed a pact to end a violent feud between them.
