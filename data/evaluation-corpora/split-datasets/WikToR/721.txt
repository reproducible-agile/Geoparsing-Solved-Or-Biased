Rama is a village in the East-Central area of Saskatchewan. It is located 44 km west of Canora and 60 km east of Wadena at the intersection of Highway 5 and Secondary Hwy 754. Rama is on the banks of Spirit Creek, a tributary of the Whitesand River. The Spirit Creek Dam and its reservoir are located just east of the Village. Rama is located on the banks of Spirit Creek and is found at the junction of Highways 5 and 754 in Saskatchewan's aspen parkland region. This area is part of the East Central economic improvement region of the province. Canada Post provides Mail and Courier services through its local post outlet, S0A 3H0 is the postal code. The RM of Invermay borders the village on all sides. Prominently featured in Rama is the Shrine of our Lady of Lourdes, a homage of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, in Lourdes, France. Many of these grottoes in Saskatchewan and eastern Alberta were created by Fr. Anthony Sylla and his parishioners. Sylla had arrived in Saskatchewan in 1909 and by 1933 was in charge of the parish in Rama. By 1939 he began to establish the shrine and pilgrimage site. The shrine was largely completed during the next two years. Updates, landscaping changes and additions to the grounds have continued gradually until today. Every year on August 14 and 15 (since 1941) St. Anthony's parish holds a 'Pilgrimage'. Mass is held in several languages, and a candlelight procession occurs. The shrine in Rama is located west of St. Anthony's church.
