Buxton is a village in the Demerara-Mahaica Region of Guyana, standing about midway between Georgetown and Enmore. Buxton Village was founded in 1840 by a group of freed Afro-Guyanese, who purchased the former Plantation Orange Nassau. Friendship, its sister village was founded in 1841 after the purchase of Plantation Friendship. The two were later joined to form the village of Buxton-Friendship, which is commonly called Buxton. Buxton Village was founded when a group of 128-132 former slaves from Annandale purchased the 580 acre plantation for 50,000 dollars. The 700 acre Friendship plantation was purchased by 168 former slaves for 80,000 dollars. Buxton, Friendship, Victoria along with other Guyanese were all collectively purchased by groups of former slaves after emancipation was enacted in 1838. The Buxton-Friendship local authority was established to interact with plantation owners, in addition to building roads, trenches and other similar infrastructure they also formed an elected village council. In 1856, the British Guiana legislature gave the government the right to enact improvement taxes on the properties of the villagers, this led to a stalemate between the government and the purchasers of Buxton.
