The original inhabitants of the Colorado High Plains near Sterling were probably paleo-Indians of the Clovis culture. The earliest known European visitors (post-Spanish exploration) to the area were primarily French fur trappers searching for fertile beaver streams in the late-1700s. By that time, the principal Indian tribes occupying the region were the Arapaho and Cheyenne, although war and hunting parties of other Plains tribes such as the Sioux and Pawnee probably passed through. Organized exploration of the area by Americans began with the visit on June 26, 1820 of the expedition of Major Stephen Harriman Long, who referred to much of the area between the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains as "The Great American Desert". One of the final battles of the Indian wars in Colorado, the Battle of Summit Springs between Tall Bull and his Cheyenne Dog Soldiers and Colonel Eugene A. Carr and the U.S. Army took place near Sterling on July 11, 1869.
