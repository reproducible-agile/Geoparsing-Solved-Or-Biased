Hampton is a city in Bradford County, Florida, United States. The population was 500 at the 2010 census. Hampton was incorporated in 1925. In the mid 1990s, Hampton annexed a short stretch of U.S. Highway 301 west of the city in order to get revenue from traffic tickets issued to motorists driving on that highway. In November 2013, the city's mayor was arrested for selling Oxycodone. On February 10, 2014 auditors from the Florida Joint Legislative Auditing Committee presented 31 violations of state law, city charter and federal tax requirements to state legislators. The city made $211,328 ticketing people driving its 1,260 feet of U.S. Highway 301 during 2012, giving the city an unenviable reputation as a "speed trap". The committee asked State Attorney Bill Cervone to investigate any potential criminal activity, and a number of state representatives and senators pursued the dissolution of Hampton. In the wake of the controversy, many city officials resigned. State legislators visited Hampton on March 28, 2014 to see if the issues had been solved. They agreed to let Hampton stay incorporated, because the city retracted the annexation of U.S. Highway 301 and decommissioned its police force. Hampton also accounted for budget shortfalls, and reformed its city council proceedings.
