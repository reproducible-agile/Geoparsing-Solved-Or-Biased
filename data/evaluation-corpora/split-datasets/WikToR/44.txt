Santa Rita (Chamorro: SÃ¥nta Rita) is a village located on the southwest coast of the United States territory of Guam with hills overlooking Apra Harbor. According to the 2000 census it has a population of 7,500, down from 11,857 in 1990. Santa Rita is the newest village in Guam, having been established after the Second World War. Prior to the War, the village of Sumay occupied the Orote Peninsula, which forms the southern boundary of Apra Harbor. Once a thriving commerce center, it suffered severe devastation from bombardment by the United States military forces during the Liberation of Guam from the Empire of Japan. The U.S. military assumed control over the ruins of Sumay and built Naval Station, while the residents of Sumay were relocated to the hills between their former village and Fena. They established a new village, naming the settlement after Saint Rita. Today, the Fena area, which houses Naval Magazine and Fena Lake (a main source of fresh water for the island), borders the eastern boundary of the village of Santa Rita. The Department of Education serves the public schools in Santa Rita.
