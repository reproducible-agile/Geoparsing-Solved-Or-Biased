Hartford is a town centrally located in Washington County, New York, United States. It is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town population was 2,279 at the 2000 census. The Provincial Patent (1766) was granted to officer veterans of the French and Indian War. The patent included, within the "Town of Westfield," the present towns of Putnam, Fort Ann, Dresden part of Kingsbury, and Hartford. The Town of Hartford was set off from Westfield in 1793. The Town of Westfield represents the Vermont claim for part of this region, which was eventually settled by the eastern part of Charlotte County being transferred from New York. Many of the early settlers came from parts of New England. The land granted by the original patent was often sold to the new settlers. The Hartford Baptist Church and Cemetery and Elisha Straight House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 43.5 square miles (113 km2), of which, 43.4 square miles (112 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of it (0.09%) is water.
