Nelson is an unincorporated community in northwestern Choctaw County, Oklahoma. It is six miles north of Soper, Oklahoma. Spencer Academy, a Choctaw Nation school, was moved here from Spencerville, Oklahoma. A United States Post Office was established at Nelson, Indian Territory on March 10, 1881 and operated until November 30, 1954. Until September 15, 1881, the official name of this post office was Nelsons. Nelson is named for Cole E. Nelson, prominent Choctaw Indian and National Attorney of the Choctaw Nation. Until the advent of Oklahoma's statehood Nelson was located in Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County), Choctaw Nation. Nelson’s livelihood as a commercial and population center was threatened after the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway built its tracks east of Nelson, passing instead through the communities of Antlers, Hamden, Speer and Hugo. Although it retained a lively community for decades following the railroad’s construction in the 1880s, the towns along the railroad sapped it of potential commercial success. Nelson continues to be home to several families, and as such remains the area’s oldest settlement.
