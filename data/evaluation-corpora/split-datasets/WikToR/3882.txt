Linton is a village and civil parish in the Maidstone District of Kent, England. The parish is located on the southward slope of the Greensand ridge, south of Maidstone on the A229 Hastings road. The name Linton comes from Old English, probably meaning Lilla's village. The steepness of the hill through it is explained because of its position on the slope of the ridge. The village has a population of about 500. According to the reference quoted below "The 13th century church of St Nicholas contains an interesting and varied collection of monuments, including some by EH Baily, who sculpted the figure of Nelson in Trafalgar Square". Linton Park is a Grade I listed mansion to the east of the village. Built in 1730 by Robert Mann, it was later home to Sir Horatio Mann, the fourth and fifth Earls Cornwallis and Fiennes Cornwallis, 1st Baron Cornwallis. It served as headquarters to the army encampment at neighbouring Coxheath during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. There is one public house 'The Bull' which is opposite the church. There is a children's playground off a lane near the bottom of the hill which can be found at the end of a path just above the turning for Wheelers Lane. Cornwallis Academy is a secondary school located in the village.
