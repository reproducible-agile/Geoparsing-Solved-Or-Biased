Beaumont is a suburb of Dublin, located on the Northside. It lies within the postal district Dublin 9, sometimes known as D9. The name derives from the French for "beautiful mount". ( named by Olivia Whitemore and Arthur Guinness in 1764) Beaumont sits at the top of a considerable ascent from Fairview and Georgian Dublin Coastlines. Its clean Air and Northside views across Georgian Dublin to Wicklow mountains inspired the name. From 1764 Olivia Whitmore and Arthur Guinness made their new family home in Beaumont House. Beaumont House is a protected structure and can be visited today Beaumont was originally a farm in the Civil Parish of Coolock, between the townlands of Kilmore Big and Kilmore Little. It is the former home of the Guinness family from 1764-1855. The original 1764 lease between Charles Gardiner and Arthur Guinness can still be seen in the National Library of Ireland. Guinness took 51 acres (210,000 m2) "more or less situate in the Parish of Coolock" on a lease for the longer of 31 years or three lives, and built a house "at Kilmore" ; it is apparent that he later named the property "Beaumont". His rent was Â£93 p.a.
