Hansi is a city and a municipal council in Hisar district in the Indian state of Haryana. Its 2011 population is estimated to be 134,568. It is located at a distance of 16 miles (26 km) east of Hisar on National Highway 10. Geographically, it is semi-arid with around 46 cm of annual rainfall. It appears that at one time Hansi was larger, more prosperous and more important than Hisar. The town has several important buildings of archeological importance. It is also a very influential sub-caste of Arain. The city of Hansi has five gates of entry â€“ Delhi Gate (East), Hisar Gate (West), Gosain Gate (North-west), Barsi Gate(South) and Umra Gate (South west). The peculiarity of this town is that its altitude increases after entry from any of the gates. Deserts guard this city towards its west (cities like Tosham, Devsar, Khanak). Another prominent feature of this ancient city is its fort. Extended in an area of 30 acres (120,000 m2), it is square in shape and has security posts in all the four corners. The fort is said to be that of Great King Prithvi Raj Chauhan.
