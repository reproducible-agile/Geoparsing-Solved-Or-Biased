Ayr (/ɛər/; Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Àir, "Mouth of the River Ayr") is a large town and former Royal Burgh sitting along the west coast of Ayrshire in Scotland. It is the administrative centre of the South Ayrshire council area and historical county town of Ayrshire. Ayr is currently the most populated settlement in Ayrshire and the south of Scotland. It is the 13th most populous locality in Scotland. The town was established as a royal burgh in 1205, serving as Ayrshire's central marketplace and harbour throughout the Medieval Period and remaining a well-renowned port across the Early Modern Period. On the southern banks of the River Ayr sits the ramparts of a Citadel, constructed by Oliver Cromwell during the mid-17th Century. The town also houses the site of famous Scottish poet Robert Burns's birthplace in the suburb of Alloway, in the south of the town, which takes in Robert Burns Cottage and the Robert Burns experience. Across the Victorian era, coal and iron remained the central export of the town, with fishing and shipping also forming a significant sect of the local economy. Ayr later developed as a seaside holiday resort, aspects of which remain the case today with the continued presence of a Butlins holiday park to the south of the town. The Gaiety Theatre ran various shows across the late 20th century, attracting performers from across the United Kingdom, and despite its decline throughout the 2000s, it remains in operation today.
