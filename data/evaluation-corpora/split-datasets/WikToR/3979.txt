Brewster is a village within the town of Southeast in Putnam County, New York, United States. Its population was 2,390 at the 2010 census. The village is the most densely populated portion of the county. The village is named for two early farmer landowners, Walter and James Brewster. The village of Brewster derives its name from the landowner, Walter Brewster, who invited New York and Harlem Railroad to build a depot on his property. Brewster's Station, New York, (sometimes just "Brewster's") appeared on maps, on postcards and in directories of Putnam County throughout the second half of the 19th century. Although referred to as a village since it formed in 1849, it officially incorporated as the Village of Brewster, New York, in 1894. In 1886, historian William Smith Pelletreau published The History of Putnam County, New York. In his second chapter on the town of Southeast, he wrote: "The land now [1886] embraced within the limits of the village of Brewster consists of a farm which was sold by the commissioners of forfeiture to Peleg Bailey, in 1781. A portion of it afterward passed into the possession of Bailey Howes, his grandson, who sold 98 acres to Gilbert Bailey, April 1st 1833. Two other tracts containing 39 acres were sold to Gilbert Bailey, by William P. Downs and Frederick Parks in 1838. On the 17th of February, 1848, Gilbert Bailey sold the whole tracts, estimated at 134 acres, to James and Walter F. Brewster, for the sum of $8,000."
