Warren County is a county located in Ohio. As of the 2010 census, the population was 212,693. Its county seat is Lebanon. The county was erected May 1, 1803, from Hamilton County, and named for Dr. Joseph Warren, a hero of the Revolution who sent Paul Revere on his ride and who died at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren County is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area. Along with Butler County, Warren County comprises the geographical center of the Cincinnati-Dayton Metropolitan Region, home to 3.3 million and the 14th most populous in the United States. This is the key factor to the county's rapid suburban growth. Warren County was created by the first Ohio General Assembly in the Act of March 24, 1803, which also created Butler and Montgomery Counties. The act defined Warren County as "all that part of the county of Hamilton included within the following bounds, viz.: Beginning at the northeast corner of the county of Clermont, running thence west with the line of said county to the Little Miami; thence up the same with the meanders thereof to the north boundary of the first tier of sections in the second entire range of townships in the Miami Purchase; thence west to the northeast corner of Section No. 7 in the third township of the aforesaid range; thence north to the Great Miami; thence up the same to the middle of the fifth range of townships; thence east to the County line; thence with same south to the place of beginning." Originally this included land now in Clinton County as far east as Wilmington.
