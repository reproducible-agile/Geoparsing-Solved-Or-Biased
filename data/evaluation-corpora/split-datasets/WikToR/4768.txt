Martin County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2010 census, the population was 24,505. Its county seat is Williamston. The county was formed in 1774 from the southeastern part of Halifax County and the western part of Tyrrell County. It was named for Josiah Martin, the last royal governor of North Carolina (1771–75). Whereas Dobbs County and Tryon County, named for Martin's predecessors Arthur Dobbs and William Tryon, were abolished after American independence, Martin County was neither abolished nor renamed, a fact which has been attributed to the popularity of Alexander Martin, twice governor of the state (1782–84, 1789–92). The Martin County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Martin County is a member of the Mid-East Commission regional council of governments. Martin County has tended to vote in line with the rest of the country in presidential elections. In 2008, Barack Obama won the county with 52.2% of the vote. This was very similar to his national figure of 52.91%.
