Ostrovo (Serbian Cyrillic: Острово) is a village in the urban municipality of Kostolac, which is part of the city of Požarevac, Serbia. According to the 2002 census, the village has a population of 685 people. "Ostrovo" means "island" in Serbian. This name originates from the fact that Ostrovo is located on former Danube island (see: Ostrvo, Kostolac) that historically was part of Banat region. In Serbian, the village is known as Ostrovo (Острово), in German as Ostrova, and in Hungarian as Temessziget. Village was formed during the Great Serb migration, led by Arsenije Čarnojević. Until 1751, Ostrovo was part of the Habsburg Banat of Temeswar and then part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. From 1848 to 1849, it was part of Serbian Vojvodina, but in 1849 it was again included into Military Frontier. After abolishment of the frontier, in 1873, Ostrovo was included into Temes County of the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary. It was part of the Kovin municipality within the county. According to 1910 census, ethnic Serbs were in absolute majority in Ostrovo. Other ethnic groups that lived in the village were Germans, Hungarians and Romanians.
