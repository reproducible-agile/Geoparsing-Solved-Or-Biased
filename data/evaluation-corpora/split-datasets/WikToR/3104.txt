Selma is a city in Bexar, Comal, and Guadalupe counties in the U.S. state of Texas. It is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,540 at the 2010 census, up from 788 at the 2000 census. The Retama Park horse racing track is located in Selma. The town was famous as a speed trap as referenced in the Steve Earle song "Guitar Town". Selma was settled in 1847 by immigrants from various countries. In 1849, the Harrison and Brown stagecoach stop was built in Selma to handle passengers and freight on the San Antonio to Austin stagecoach line. John Harrison and his wife Martha moved to Selma in 1852, and he became the first postmaster of the town when the post office opened in 1856. Harrison was also co-owner of the Harrison and McCulloch stage line, which ran a postal route through Selma. Harrison's house still stands by Cibolo Creek, where it was built and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. German and Polish immigrants constituted most of the next wave of immigrants that settled in the area. By 1885, the population was 145, and at the turn of the century, the population peaked at 600. The population began a quick decline, so much that by 1906 the post office was closed. Selma's population dropped to 100 in 1940. The city incorporated in 1964 and has seen tremendous growth along the Interstate 35 corridor since 2000.
