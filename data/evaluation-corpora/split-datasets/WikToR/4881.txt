Longwood is located at 28°42′07″N 81°20′42″W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.6 square miles (15 km2). 5.3 square miles (14 km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2) of it (5.17%) is water. Coastal tribes used "The Senator", a 3000-year-old bald cypress which burned down in 2012, to find their way over land from the St. Johns River to trading grounds at Spring Hammock. Later, when Creek Indians and others from the tribes of the Southeast United States fled into Spanish Florida and settled new villages among escaped African slaves, they became the Seminoles. Longwood, as well as most of Seminole County, shares its American Colonial history with the early settlement of Orange, Lake, Brevard, Volusia and Osceola Counties that make up the Greater Orlando metropolitan area and its surrounding environs. Central Florida's development began after the Second Seminole War. By the early 1860s, the cities of Sanford and Orlando were small settlements. Settlers began arriving at what would become Longwood during the lull between the end of the Seminole Wars in the 1850s and the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861.
