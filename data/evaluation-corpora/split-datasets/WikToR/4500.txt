Newburgh is a town in Ohio Township, Warrick County, Indiana, United States, located just east of Evansville, Indiana along the Ohio River. The population was 3,325 at the 2010 census, although the town is part of the larger Evansville metropolitan area which recorded a population of 342,815, and Ohio Township, which Newburgh shares with nearby Chandler has a population of 37,749 in the 2010 Census. By 1850 Newburgh was one of the larger riverports between Cincinnati and New Orleans, and it was the first town north of the Mason–Dixon line to be captured by Confederate forces during the American Civil War. Shortly after the mid-nineteenth century Newburgh's growth leveled off until the economic boom of the 1960s and 70’s resulted in substantial growth as a bedroom community for families looking for new housing developments near Evansville. Today, Newburgh is locally known for its charming, historic downtown district that features a number of specialty stores, antique shops, and quaint dining establishments along its riverfront. Due to its top-rated schools and family-friendly atmosphere, the town remains a popular residential community for people working in or near Evansville.
