Durham is a town in Greene County, New York, United States. The population was 2,725 at the 2010 census. The town was named after Durham, Connecticut. The Town of Durham is in the northwest corner of the county. The town was first settled around 1755 within Albany County. The town was established from part of the Town of Coxsackie in 1790 as the "Town of Freehold." In the spring of 1800 Freehold became part of the newly formed Greene County. The town's name was changed to "Durham" in 1805, the town having been called informally "New Durham" by the many settlers from Connecticut. Part of the town was lost to form, in 1803, the new Towns of Cairo, Greenville, and Windham. In 1836, the western part of Durham became the Town of Conesville in Schoharie County. The first documented visit to the Durham area was by Eliab Youmans who had been commissioned to survey the Maitland patents in 1767. Undoubtedly, explorers, hunters, and trappers preceded Youmans, but their travels were unrecorded. The patents were the first official parceling out of the largely unclaimed land and were the precursors to settlement. Eight patents have been identified for lands that were in, or partly in the Town of Durham.
