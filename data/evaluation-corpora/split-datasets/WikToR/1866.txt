Goro is one of the woredas in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. It shares the same name as the administrative center of the woreda, Goro. Part of the Bale Zone, Goro is bordered on the southwest by Guradamole, on the west by Berbere, on the northwest by Sinanana Dinsho, on the northeast by Ginir, and on the southeast by the Somali Region; it is separated from Guradamole and Berbere by the Gestro River (or Weyib River). Other towns in this woreda include Meliyu. Dawe Kachen woreda was separated from Goro. Almost three-fourths of this woreda is covered by plains, and the rest are considered hilly or rugged. Mount Holachis is the highest point; other important peaks include Mounts Dadimos and Farra. Perennial rivers include the Weyib and the Mena, which are lined by forest. A survey of the land in this woreda shows that 17.7% is arable (5.9% was under cultivation), 38% pasture, 39.3% forest or heavy vegetation, and the remaining 5.3% is considered swampy, mountainous or otherwise unusable. 18.16 square kilometers of forest are part of the Goro Bale State Forest. Notable landmarks in this woreda include the Sof Omar Caves. Sugar cane, oil seeds, spices and vegetables are important cash crops.
