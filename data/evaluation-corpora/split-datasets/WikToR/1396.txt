Sande is a municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of "Sande i Vestfold". The municipality of Sande was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The municipality is located about 60 kilometres (37 mi) (50 minutes driving time) south of Oslo, and lies beautifully by the sea. In recent years, the administrative center of Sande has grown significantly due to a large number of new apartments and stores. Parts of the Olsenbanden-movie Olsenbanden tar gull from 1973 was filmed in Sande, and another part in Stavern. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Sande farm (Old Norse: Sandvin), since the first church was built here. The first element is sandr which means "sand" and the last element is vin meaning "meadow" or "pasture". The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 19 December 1986. The arms represent a silver-colored Sandebukta bay, with its typical triangular shape, surrounded by the forests and mountains.
