Bor, also known as the City of Bor or Bortown, is the capital of Jonglei State in the Republic of South Sudan. Bor is of historical importance to the people of South Sudan. It was in Malek, a small settlement about 19 kilometres (12 mi) south of Bor, that the first modern Christian mission in present-day South Sudan was established by Archibald Shaw in December 1905. Bor became the first area to host a Church Missionary Society station in 1905. Malek was turned into a missionary stronghold in the Upper Nile Region. Shaw opened the first primary school in Malek. This school produced the first indigenous Anglican bishop to be consecrated in Dinkaland, Rt. Rev. Daniel Deng Atong, followed the Nikonora Achiek Deng Ariir. John Aruor became the first legend to be baptized in 1916 in Bor. Bor became an administrative centre under the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899â€“1956) for the Dinka people. Bor is the epicenter of the Second Sudanese Civil War. Dr. John Garang De Mabior, an officer in the Sudanese Army led a revolt in the town of Bor, in May of 1983, leading to the birth of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA). Bor was also the scene of the 1991 Bor massacre, where approximately 20000 people were killed. Eventually South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011.
