San Felipe is a fourth class municipality in the province of Zambales, Philippines. According to the 2010 Philippine census, it has a population of 22,020 people. Much of the population are Ilocanos, descendants of migrants from Ilocos. The town was affected by the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, being buried in about a meter in volcanic ash but damage was comparatively light. San Felipe was one among the little villages along the coastal region of Zambales during the pre-Spanish period. The first inhabitants were the Malay Zambas who lived in lowland which they themselves called Hindol. There were also Negritoes but most of them lived in mountains. A few years after the discovery of the Philippines, all places in the country had been explored by the Spanish authorities and the exploration of Zambales began in 1572 by Juan de Salcedo, grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, first Spanish Governor General of the Philippines. Juan de Salcedo and Spanish followers made a survey of its coastal region and organize communities which were first called encomiendas but which were later called pueblos. As the population of the villages increased which was caused by the steady immigration of Ilocanos from the Ilocandia region before 1800 until 1860, more pueblos were organized.
