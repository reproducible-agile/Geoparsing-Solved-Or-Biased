Toledo is a city located on the Yaquina River and along U.S. Route 20 in Lincoln County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. The population was 3,465 at the 2010 census. The city was a 2009 All-America City Award finalist. European-American settlement in Toledo began in 1866, when John Graham, his son Joseph, and William Mackey, claimed land made available by the Homestead Act. The site was called "Graham's Landing" until a post office was established two years later. Joseph D. Graham, John's son, named the post office for Toledo, Ohio, because he was homesick. William Mackey was the first postmaster. Toledo was made the county seat of the newly established Lincoln County in 1893. The city incorporated in 1893 and reincorporated in 1905. Charles Barton Crosno served as the first mayor. The county seat moved from Toledo to Newport in 1953. In 1918, the Port of Toledo leased land to the Spruce Production Division for a sawmill to cut airplane frames for World War I. However, before production began, the war ended. C. D. Johnson and associates then bought the mill and related equipment, which by 1923 processed logs shipped to Toledo by rail. Georgia-Pacific acquired the operation in 1951 and turned it into a pulp mill.
