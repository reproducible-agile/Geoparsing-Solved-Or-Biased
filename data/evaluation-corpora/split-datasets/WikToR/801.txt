Xiangyang (simplified Chinese: 襄阳; traditional Chinese: 襄陽) is a prefecture-level city in northwestern Hubei province, People's Republic of China. It was formed from two ancient cities, Xiangyang and Fancheng. It was known as Xiangfan (Chinese: 襄樊) until December 2, 2010. Xiangyang is divided by the Han River, which runs through its heart and divides the city north-south. The city itself is an incorporation of two once separate, ancient cities: Fancheng and Xiangzhou. What remains of old Xianyang is located south of the Han River and contains one of the oldest still-intact city walls in China while Fancheng was located to the north of the Han River. Both cities served prominent historical roles in both the Ancient and Pre-Modern Periods of Chinese history. Today, the city is, after the capital Wuhan, the second largest in the province, located about halfway between Wuhan and Xi'an. It is considered one of the third tier cities in China and has been a target of government and private investment as the country seeks to urbanize and develop the interior provinces.
