Stanton is a small village situated at the eastern end of the Weaver Hills, Staffordshire, England. Stanton is located 146 miles (235.0 km) north-west of London and 18.4 miles (29.6 km) east of Stoke-on-Trent. It has a population of 232 according to the 2001 Census. The landscape around the village is mainly pastureland bounded by dry stone walls. Evidence of early human activity can be found at Stanton with three bronze age barrows on the hilltop of Thorswood. In 1953 a gold bracelet was found in the parish dated circa 800 BC, now housed in the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke on Trent. Stanton is listed in the Domesday Book as Stantone, the name means "Stone Farmstead" which could refer to its building material, some prominent stone or its site on stony ground. The stone itself is an excellent building material, mainly sandstone, being used to build the majority of farmhouses and cottages in the village. In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson described Stanton in his Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as "a township-chapelry in Ellastone parish, Stafford; 2½ miles WNW of Clifton r. station, and 3½ W of Ashborne. Post town, Ashborne. Real property, £1,996. Pop., 403. Houses, 81. The living is annexed to Ellastone. Archbishop Sheldon was a native.".
