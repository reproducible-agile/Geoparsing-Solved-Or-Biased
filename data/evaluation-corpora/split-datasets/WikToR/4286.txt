Haimen (simplified Chinese: 海门; traditional Chinese: 海門; pinyin: Hǎimén, Qihai dialect: [haɪ.məŋ], Shanghai: [hɛ̝.məŋ]) is a county-level city under the administration of Nantong, Jiangsu province, with a population of approximately 1 million. It is located at the opposite side of the Yangtze River to Shanghai and is directly north of Chongming Island except for a small portion that forms Haimen City's Haiyong Township. Chonghai Bridge links the city to Chongming County. Haimen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Haimen. The area that is now Haimen was formed from silt deposits from the Yangtze River. Several sandbanks, including Dongzhou (东洲; 東洲) and Buzhou (布洲), joined together with the mainland in the Tang dynasty. In 958 CE, during the Later Zhou dynasty in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Haimen County was established, the seat established at Dongzhou Town. Because the mouth of the Yangtze River moved northward during the Ming dynasty, Haimen has dealt with flooding that destroyed parts of the county, including Lüsi (吕四; 呂四), Yudong (余东; 余東), and Sijia (Chinese: 四甲).
