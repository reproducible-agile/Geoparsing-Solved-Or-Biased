Seaforth is a district within the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England. Historically in Lancashire, it is located to the north of Liverpool, between Bootle and Waterloo. The name of Seaforth is thought to come from the Old Norse sæ-fjord, sæ-ford, "sea inlet". It was recorded as Safforde "sea ford" in 1128, suggesting Old English name origins. Another theory for the name of the area is that it was taken from Seaforth House, named after Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth, who built the mansion in 1813 for his daughter and her husband, Sir John Gladstone, father of William Ewart Gladstone, four times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. A permanent military presence was established in the borough with the completion of Seaforth Barracks in 1882. Seaforth Dock opened in 1972 and is the largest dock facility on the River Mersey. It is part of the Port of Liverpool and Liverpool Freeport. Seaforth joined Crosby Municipal Borough in 1937, having previously been part of Waterloo with Seaforth urban district. The whole of Crosby became part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Sefton on 1 April 1974.
