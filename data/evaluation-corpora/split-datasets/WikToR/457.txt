Waterloo is a city in Quebec, included in La Haute-Yamaska Regional County Municipality, in the administrative area of Montérégie. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census was 4,330. Completely encircled by the township of Shefford, this residential city is located within the Eastern Townships, about ninety kilometers east of Montreal. It was first settled in 1793 by Ezekiel Lewis, an English Loyalist supporter who was originally from Marlborough, New Hampshire. He named his location Lewis Falls and after 9 years, Captain Ezekiel Lewis sold his lot and moved only a short distance. The land was purchased by William Lamoure, a merchant from St-Armand who then sold it to Lazare Letourneau who in turn sold it to Hezekiah Robinson in 1822. Robinson immediately renamed Lewis Falls to Waterloo after the famous battle in which Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated. The name Waterloo was suggested by his Father-in-law. Waterloo became the summer residence of Montreal industrialist James Davidson in the 1880s. Davidson was the son of Scottish immigrant Thomas Davidson, who founded The Thos. Davidson Manufacturing Company, Ltd., a producer of enameled tinware with offices throughout Canada and around the world. Davidson established "Ayrmont Farm" on the western side of the town. The main house, "Orford View," still stands on Mountain Street. The guest bungalow across the road and surrounding property are still in the hands of the family.
