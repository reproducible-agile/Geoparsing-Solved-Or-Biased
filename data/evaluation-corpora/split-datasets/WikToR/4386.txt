Spring Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in rural Hernando County, Florida, United States. The estimated population was 98,621 in 2010 by the United States Census. Spring Hill belongs to Florida's Nature Coast and is in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. Spring Hill is a working class area located north of Tampa, FL. Spring Hill first appeared on Hernando County Maps in the mid-1800s along what is today Fort Dade Avenue just north of the community of Wiscon. The modern Spring Hill was founded in 1967 as a planned community, which was developed by the Deltona Corporation and the Mackle Brothers who built the community. The plans for the community are actually identical to the community of Deltona, Florida. The Mackle Brothers sold many of the properties and land in the area through intense advertising. It appeared on maps of Florida as early as 1856. It has since become a sprawling semi-city in its own right, though it is an unincorporated area. The main entrance to the original development is marked by the Spring Hill waterfall on Spring Hill Drive and U.S. Route 19 (Commercial Way). Its location has Hernando Beach to the west, Brooksville, Florida to the east, and Tampa to the south via the Suncoast Parkway, US 41, and I-75.
