Buzuluk (Russian: Бузулу́к) is a town in Orenburg Oblast, Russia, located on the Samara, Buzuluk, and Domashka Rivers 246 kilometers (153 mi) northwest of Orenburg. Population: 82,904 (2010 Census); 87,286 (2002 Census); 83,994 (1989 Census). It was founded in 1736 as the fortress of Buzulukskaya (Бузулу́кская) on the Samara River near the mouth of the Buzuluk River along Russia's southern frontier. It was later moved to its current place near the source of the Domashka River. It was granted town status in 1781. An important development was the opening, in 1877, of the railway line connecting Samara with Orenburg. Buzuluk was a principal stop along the line, and it is from this period that the town's first power station dates, along with its first schools and libraries. Supported by the rail link and other new infrastructure developments, it now became an important rail-terminal for the transportation of wheat. The population almost doubled between the end of the nineteenth century and 1926. Buzuluk was the base of the First Czechoslovak Independent Field Battalion, the Czechoslovakian army unit that fought alongside the Red Army during World War II when Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Germans.
