The county seat is Prosser, and its largest city is Kennewick. The Columbia River demarcates the north, south, and east boundaries of the county. Benton County was created from what were then larger versions of Klickitat County and Yakima County on 8 March 1905. and was named after U.S. Senator from Missouri (1821-1851) and later U.S. Representative (1853-1855) Thomas Hart Benton. Columbia River - Surrounds and forms the county's boundary on three sides. Barge trafficking is possible upriver to anchorage sites in northern Richland, the upstream extent of Lake Wallula which forms behind McNary Dam. Yakima River - Bisects the county from west to east, emptying into the Columbia River at Richland. As a water source, the Yakima is the lifesource for agriculture in the Yakima Valley. A shallow river, the Yakima is suitably navigable only for small, personal watercraft. Historically, the Yakima River supported some of the most bountiful migratory fish populations in the entire Columbia Basin, and many of those legendary salmon runs are now rebounding after decades of demise. Amon Creek is the most notable tributary of the Yakima River in Benton County, emptying into the mainstem river near its estuary in Richland.
