Nanton is a town in southern Alberta, Canada. Nanton was named after Sir Augustus Meredith Nanton, of Winnipeg (1860â€“1925) who directed firms that offered financing for farms and ranches throughout the west. It is located south of Calgary, at the junction of Highway 2 and Highway 533. Nanton was historically known as "Tap Town", after providing passing motorists with free water supplied from the foothills via a stand tap on the northbound highway. This water was one of this first to be bottled and sold in Canada, resulting in the creation of Nanton Water & Soda Ltd, still a thriving business in the town today.
