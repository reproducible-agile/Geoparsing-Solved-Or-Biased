Dundee (29°33′S 151°51′E) is a rural locality about 40 kilometres north of Glen Innes on the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales, Australia. It is situated on the New England Highway at the Severn River in Severn parish, Gough County, New South Wales. The elevation is 985 metres. In 1838 John Baker and several others left Sydney to seek land and setup stations on the Northern Tablelands. After the others selected their land Baker continued north to secure the lease of 40,000 acres (160 km2), which he called "Dareel Plains", later to become Dundee. By 1844 the property had been sold several times before Major Archibald Clunes Innes took it over that year. At one stage Innes was one of the wealthiest men in the Colony, but suffered heavily during the 1840s depression and was declared bankrupt in 1852. In 1845 the newly established Dundee flour mill was the first flour mill north of Aberdeen, New South Wales. Major Innes built the ‘Golden Fleece’ Hotel at Dundee in 1847, to become one of the first three hotels built in New England. The large colonial style brick building was the first important building to be erected near the shallow river crossing.
