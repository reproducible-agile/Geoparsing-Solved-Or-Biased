Montgomery is believed to be the location of an early settlement in the Savannah area (prior to General Oglethorpe's land grant in 1733) founded by three brothers, William, James, and Robert Montgomery, who were baronets, under a land grant of 1677. They failed to maintain a permanent settlement, due to poor location and disease, and so lost the English land grant. The brothers moved to the more established Virginia Colony. The name of the settlement continues in this area of Savannah as well as Montgomery Street and Montgomery Crossroad.
