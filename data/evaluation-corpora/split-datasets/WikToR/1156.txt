Ceres is a village in Fife, Scotland, located in a small glen approximately 2 miles over the Ceres Moor from Cupar and 7 miles from St Andrews. The former parish of that name included the settlements of Baldinnie, Chance Inn, Craigrothie, Pitscottie and Tarvit Mill. It is one of the most historic and picturesque villages in Scotland and one of the few Scottish villages to have a village green, known as the "Bow Butts" since its use as an archery practice ground in medieval times. The Ceres Burn runs through the village and alongside the green. An old packhorse bridge, known as the "Bishop's Bridge" has spanned the burn since the 17th century and still stands close to a more modern road bridge. The village's most memorable feature is possibly the 18th century statue of "The Provost". It is thought to depict the Rev. Thomas Buchanan (related to the 17th century theologian George Buchanan), who became the last church provost of Ceres in 1578. The figure portrays him as a toby jug and is probably satirical. The sculptor, a local stonemason named James Howie, also carved a panel below the figure depicting the Battle of Bannockburn.
