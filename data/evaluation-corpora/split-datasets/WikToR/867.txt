Dublin is a city in Franklin, Delaware, and Union counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 41,751 at the 2010 census. Dublin is a suburb of Columbus, Ohio. Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the Memorial Tournament, a stop on golf's PGA Tour. Consequently, numerous golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also several other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club (closed in 2014) was home to the American-Italian Golf Association.

Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the Muirfield association, as well as the Jack Nicklaus-designed The Country Club of Muirfield Village. Other annual events include the July 4 music event, a St. Patrick's Day parade, and the Dublin Irish Festival, which is one of the largest Irish-American festivals.
