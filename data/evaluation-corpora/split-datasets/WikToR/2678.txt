Gonda is a city and municipal board of Gonda district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is situated 125 km north east of the state capital Lucknow. Gonda is divided into four tahsils named Gonda, Colonelganj, Tarabganj and Mankapur. Gonda is located at 27.13°N 81.93°E﻿ / 27.13; 81.93. The name of this district comes from the Sanskrit - Hindi word of Goshala, meaning cowshed. The cowsheds of the royal lineage of Ayodhya viz. Ikshavaku (Raghukul) of the Solar dynasty were located here. The territory covered by the present district of Gonda is a part of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. After the departure of Lord Rama to Saket dham, the celebrated sovereign of the Solar line who ruled Kosala, the kingdom was divided into two portions defined by the Ghaghara river. The northern portion was then ruled by his son, Lava with the city of Sravasti as his capital. Sravasti was prosperous and progressive during Buddhas time. More recently, ancient Buddhist remains dating to the early days of Buddhism have been found throughout the region, including Sravasti.
