Stanton is an unincorporated community in New Castle County, Delaware, United States, near the confluence of the Red Clay and White Clay Creeks. It is located in the southern end of Mill Creek Hundred. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area around Stanton was frequented by Native American peoples. A paleo-Indian archaeology site, referred to as the Clyde Farm site, is located southwest of the area. Stanton is located near the Piedmont fall line along the banks of the Red Clay Creek. First settled around 1679, it was the first settlement in Mill Creek Hundred. Many small watermills dotted the area and a farm road from Chester County, Pennsylvania terminated on the banks of Red Clay Creek. The village was originally known as "Cuckoldstown", perhaps for an inn that allegedly served as a meeting place for illicit rendezvous. The village was renamed after Stephen Stanton, a prominent landowner in the village. In August 1777, George Washington erected fortifications in the area, expecting to confront British troops recently landed at Head of Elk, Maryland. Washington and his staff held a war council in the Hale-Byrnes House. The expected battle did not develop, though, as General Howe moved his army north towards Chester County, Pennsylvania.
