Canterbury is a suburb in south-western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Canterbury is located 10.5 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district in the City of Canterbury. The City of Canterbury takes its name from the suburb but its administrative centre is located in the adjacent suburb of Campsie, which is also a large commercial centre. Canterbury is surrounded by Ashbury to the north, Campsie to the west, Earlwood to the south, and Hurlstone Park to the east. In 1770, the land along the Cooks River was explored by British officers from the HMS Bark Endeavour. In 1793, the area's first land grant was made to the Chaplain of the First Fleet, the Rev. Richard Johnson. He gave the 100 acre (40 hectare) grant, located one mile (1.6 km) north of the river, the name Canterbury Vale. The grant was passed onto William Cox, who sold the land for 525 pounds to Robert Campbell in May 1803, after going bankrupt. By 1834 the Campbell Estate grew to 1,242 acres (5 kmÂ²). In 1865, daughter Sarah Jeffrey subdivided the land into allotments, each containing several acres. The first major industry was established in 1841 with the building of the Australian Sugar Company's sugar mill by the Cooks River to produce molasses and spirits. Other industries and trades such as boiling down works and tanneries later developed along the river. The Methodists built the first church in the suburb, with services beginning in 1841. The railway line was completed in 1895, encouraging suburban development and leading to the area becoming heavily populated. This was too late for the Sugar Mill, which ceased production in September 1854, but was favourable for horse racing, which informally began in 1871.
