Moira ([mɔjɽɛ̃ː]) is a village in the Bardez Taluka of the North Goa District in India. It has been home to a number of notable individuals from Goa, and is known for its bananas (known as Mundollchim kellim in Konkani). In his essay "The Wise Fools of Moira", Prof Lucio Rodrigues writes: "Moira is a village in the district of Bardez in Goa. It lies a few miles away from Mapuca, the capital of the district, and the river of Mapuca flows along its southern, western and northern sides, making its soil very fertile. The village is famous for many things, among others for its banana plantations, which yield big, long bananas, called munnouchinz kellim in Konkani, and each fruit is equal to a square meal... But the bananas are not Moira’s chief claim to fame among Goan villages. The people are as famous, if not more than their kellim, so famous indeed that they have passed into simile and proverb and legend. They are among the most industrious people of Goa.... This wisdom has a stamp of its own which defies definition.... Even in Konkani it has not been possible to give this baffling quality an appropriate term. This is how the people of Bardez describe the indefinite trait. To moiddekar num re, he is a guy from Moira, sar-koch moiddekar, every inch like a guy from Moira; taka matxem moiddechem assa, he’s got a bit of it from Moira. That it is the thing."
