Donnybrook is a small town and locality of the Moreton Bay Region, Queensland, Australia. It is 60 kilometres (37 mi) north of Brisbane, the state capital. At the 2011 census, its population was 461. The closest major population centre is Caboolture, 20 kilometres (12 mi) to the west. The town name was approved by the Queensland Place Names Board on 1 October 1975. The name appears to be derived from a corroboree site, or because of fights amongst oyster gatherers at weekend camps. The town started out as a small fishing community but has since developed into a minor tourist destination. Pumicestone Post Office opened on 1 August 1958. It was renamed Donnybrook in 1976. In 1985, an unsealed road running along the waterfront was named Grant Lane after Robert Grant (1895 â€“ 15 November 1991) for his 90th birthday, a popular local who everyone knew as "Pop". A few years later the road was sealed after he had complained for years of the dust produced by all the passers-by. Sand mining and sewerage works have recently been proposed for the area.
