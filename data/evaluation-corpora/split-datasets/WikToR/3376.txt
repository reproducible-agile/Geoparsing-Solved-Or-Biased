Vermont (/vərˈmɒnt/ or /vɜːrˈmɒnt/, locally: [vɚˈmɑ̟̃(ʔ)]) is the second least populous of the 50 states in the United States of America, containing roughly 40,000 more people than Wyoming. Geographically located in the northeastern part of the country, Vermont shares borders with the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and an international border with the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York. The Green Mountains run north-south the length of the state and forests cover approximately 75% of its total land area. Vermont is the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States. Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes (the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and the Iroquois), much of the territory that is now Vermont was claimed by France during its early colonial period. France ceded the territory to Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the US). For many years, the nearby colonies, especially the Provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants). Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the Vermont Republic. Founded in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, the republic lasted for fourteen years. Aside from the Thirteen Colonies, Vermont is one of only four U.S. states that was previously a sovereign state (along with California, Hawaii, and Texas). In 1791, Vermont joined the United States as the 14th state, the first in addition to the original 13 colonies. Vermont was the first state to partially abolish slavery while still independent and played an important geographical role in the Underground Railroad, which helped American slaves escape to Canada.
