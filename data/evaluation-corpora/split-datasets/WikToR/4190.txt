Dundee is a village in Yates County, New York, USA. The population was 1,725 at the 2010 census. The name was taken from Dundee, the city in Scotland with a population of 160,000. The Village of Dundee is in the Town of Starkey. The village is in the Finger Lakes Region of New York, halfway between Elmira and Geneva. Dundee Airport (D48) is located northeast of the village. The community was known early by the name "Plainview". At first, the village did not thrive due to competition from another neighboring community, "Eddytown", but eventually prevailed over its rival. Around 1834, residents began to seek a new name for the village and, persuaded by a native of Scotland, named the village "Dundee". He then moved to Illinois and persuaded the natives of his new home to rename their community "Dundee". In 1859, 1860, and 1861, the village was severely damaged by fires. Dundee was the original home of Seneca Foods. The Uriah Hair House, Dundee Methodist Church, First Presbyterian Church, and Dundee Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
