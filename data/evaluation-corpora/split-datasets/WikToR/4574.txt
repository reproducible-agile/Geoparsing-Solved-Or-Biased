Dillon is a city in and the county seat of Beaverhead County, Montana, United States. The population was 4,134 at the 2010 census. The town was named for Union Pacific Railroad President Sidney Dillon. Dillon was founded in the Beaverhead Valley as a railroad town in 1880 by Union Pacific Railroad President Sydney Dillon. The location of Dillon was selected by the railroad because of its close location to gold mines in the area. Gold was first discovered in the Dillon area at Grasshopper Creek in 1862. The last real gold rush in the Dillon area happened in the Argenta area in 1920 and lasted for 30 years. The first ore that was discovered in the Dillon areas was silver. Gold was found soon after and this discovery caused people to come to the area in droves. Dillon served as a central location for transporting goods to boom towns such as Bannack, Argenta, Glen, and Virginia City. In 1881 Dillon became part of a contentious battle with Bannack to become the county seat of Beaverhead County. The first brick building was built in the frontier town of Dillon in 1882.
