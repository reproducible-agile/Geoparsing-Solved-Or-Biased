Campamento is a municipality in the south west of the Honduran department of Olancho, south of Concordia and west of Juticalpa. The municipality of Campamento is located at the entrance to Olancho, along the main highway from Tegucigalpa. The town of Campamento is located near the center of the municipality, just north of the main highway. Campamento is located in a mountainous area with large areas of pine forests. Small farms cover the lower valleys in the area, predominantly growing beans and corn. The higher elevations support large coffee farms. Campamento is known for its large pine forests, which are harvested and processed in local lumber mills. Near the eastern edge of Campamento, along the Rio Guayape, is a large fish farm that raises Tilapias for export. The center of the town of Campamento has two small hotels, several restaurants, shops, supermarkets, and a post office. A small central park is located along the main street, surrounded by the Alcaldia (municipal/town hall) on the west side and the Catholic church Santa Anna on the east side. Local buses run several times daily to Tegucigalpa from the central park, and buses from Juticalpa and Catacamas pass by town on the main highway on the south side of town.
