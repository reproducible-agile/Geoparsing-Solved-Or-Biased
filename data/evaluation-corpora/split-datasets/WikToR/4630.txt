Savannah is an unincorporated community in Jackson County, North Carolina, United States. Savannah is located along North Carolina Highway 116 and US 441, south of Dillsboro and southeast of Webster. It has its own fire department, a community center, and a couple of businesses lining US 441 and NC 116, and little else except homes. Savannah Township was originally settled after the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The first settlers in the area were homesteaders, and they built their farmsteads in the valley and hills located in the area. The area has several cemeteries and churches, the origins of which go back to this period of time. The present church buildings are much more modern than the originals, though. The valley was formed over millions of years by the erosive power of Savannah Creek, which flows north-west, following the course of US 441 and later NC 116 before emptying into the Tuckasegee River near Webster. The area was home to several small communities, some with their own school, store, community center, and post office. Greens Creek, Gay, Viewpoint, Olivet, and East Fork were the five communities that made up Savannah. In the 1920s, new schools at Greens Creek and Gay opened, consolidating three one-room schools in each community. The 1920s also led to the opening up of the Savannah Communities to the outside world, via the two-lane paved US 441 built during the decade, near the present five-lane road. US 441 was a modern two-lane and paved highway from Franklin to Dillsboro at the time.
