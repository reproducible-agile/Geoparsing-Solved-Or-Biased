Davenport is a district of Stockport, Greater Manchester in the North West region of England.The 2011 census gave a total population (including Cale Green) of 14,924. Davenport's name arose from the building of Davenport railway station at the behest of the Davenport family who since the later 14th century had owned nearby Bramall Hall in the neighbouring village of Bramhall. The family, in its turn, took its name from their ancestral estate of that name located between Holmes Chapel and Congleton, in mid-Cheshire, an estate recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is listed as 'Deneport'. Originally Davenport's expansion in the 1850s consisted of three key routes; Bramhall Lane, Kennerley Road and Buxton Road, all of which remain in place today. The aforementioned railway station is positioned at Davenport's main road junction, and allows travel by rail towards Manchester, Stockport, Hazel Grove, and Buxton. The 1900s saw an increase in construction of residential houses and commercial developments. Later, the aftermath of World War II saw the demolition of larger, older properties, standing in quite extensive gardens, to make way for the building of smaller private residences and flats in Davenport.
