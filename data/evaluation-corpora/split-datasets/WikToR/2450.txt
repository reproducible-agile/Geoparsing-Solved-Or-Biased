Jackson County is a county located in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2010 census, the population was 26,446. Its county seat is Altus. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the county was named for two historical figures: President Andrew Jackson and Confederate General Stonewall Jackson. One source states only that the county was named for the former President, while an earlier source states it was only named for General Stonewall Jackson. Jackson County comprises the Altus, OK Micropolitan Statistical Area. After a dispute over the Adams-On√≠s Treaty of 1819, both the governments of the United States and the state of Texas claimed ownership of some 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) in what was then operated as Greer County, Texas. Litigation followed, and in the case of United States v. State of Texas 162 U.S. 1 (1896), issued on March 16, the Supreme Court, having original jurisdiction over the case, decided in favor of the United States. Greer County was then assigned to the Oklahoma Territory on May 4, 1896, and when Oklahoma became a state, in addition to becoming Jackson County, the region was also further split into Greer, Harmon, and part of Beckham counties.
