Greenwich is a Canadian rural community located in eastern Kings County, Nova Scotia. It was previously known as Noggins Corner, as travelers could procure a noggin of rum at a local public house. The community is bordered to the south by the Wolfville Ridge, immediately west of the town of Wolfville and east of the village of New Minas. It is also bordered on the north by the south bank of the Cornwallis River, opposite the village of Port Williams. In 1910 the present church opened in Greenwich as a Methodist meeting house. In 1925 it became part of the United Church of Canada and is now part of the pastoral charge of St Andrews, Wolfville. The community has hosted Horton High School in two different locations since 1959. Greenwich has a population of approximately 300 people. Water, sewer, hydrant, streetlights, bus transit and sidewalk services make this hamlet a desirable rural residential area within easy access of both New Minas and Wolfville. Greenwich is also served by a volunteer fire department. Greenwich has been primarily agricultural in nature since being first settled by families including the Bishop and Forsyth families, who settled here in 1760 as New England Planters; both of these families still farm in Greenwich today. Five farm markets in this small community make it the destination of choice for in-season produce in Kings County. Hennigar's, one of the oldest farm markets in the province, opened in 1921. Noggins Corner Farm Market is on the site of Timothy and William Bishop's farm and is run by members of the Bishop family.
