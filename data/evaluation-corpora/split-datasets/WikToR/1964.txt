Topa is a village in Mendhar Tehsil, Poonch district in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Battle of Topa was fought here by 5 Gorkha Rifles. Topa is located at 33.65°N 74.11°E﻿ / 33.65; 74.11. It has an average elevation of 1,126 metres (3,694 feet). From anti infiltration operations conducted by the battalion from 5 August 1965 onwards in Rajouri and Mendhar Sectors of Jammu and Kashmir, it was evident that many strong infiltrating columns of Pakistani Army had been sent into our territory as part of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Gibraltar’. By third week of August 65, Headquarter 52 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier later Lieutenant General R D Hira, MVC) had been inducted into the sector for clearance of infiltrators from Mendhar, Surankot and Krishna Ghati area. For the operations 4/5 GR (FF), 14 Kumaon and 3/11 GR were put under command of the brigade and made responsible for anti infiltration operations in Mendhar in the South and Krishna Gati (KG) area of 93 Infantry Brigade Sector. Reports of major infiltration in Mendhar and Balnoi had been received and some of the roads had been blocked by Paki troops. Closer to Mendhar, Paki's had occupied Topa feature, which effectively dominated fair weather road Mendhar - Balnoi, thus cutting off Balnoi and Krishna Ghati (93 Infantry Brigade). They had also established defences at a place called OP Hill, on the ridgeline across Mendhar River. The first priority of the brigade was to cut off maintenance routes of these Paki troops and clearance of road to Balnoi and KG. Alfa Company of 21 AK Battalion Pakistan Army, with additional troops and Razakars were reported to be occupying Topa Height (Pt 4571) and had effectively interdicted road communications in the area.
