Puerto Escondido is a large natural harbor in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. It is located in the Loreto Municipality 28 km south of Loreto, on Federal Highway 1 on the western shore of the Gulf of California. French architect and urban planner Fran√ßois Spoerry designed a neighborhood of Puerto Escondido. but it was abandoned after only 3 (now abandoned) buildings were constructed. . The nearest community to Puerto Escondido is Tripui, a privately owned leasehold community, largely of ex-pat Americans and Canadians with a store, hotel and restaurant. It is about 1 kilometer from Puerto Escondido. The main harbor is about 1.8 km long and 1 km wide with a 30 meter wide entrance and 3 meter depth. It has been a popular anchorage with visiting sailors and is widely recognized as one of the best 'hurricane holes' in the Sea of Cortez. Adjacent to the main harbor is an abandoned marina project, "the Ellipse" and seaward of the Ellipse is a large, somewhat protected anchorage known as the "Waiting Room" to sailors and "Enfermario" to local Mexicans. The port is administered by API-BCS who charge for anchoring in the port. The inner harbor is leased to Fonatur who installed a small marina and moorings for rent. There is a small boatyard, grocery store and restaurant in the marina. A privately owned marina (Marina Puerto Escondido) was opened in the fall of 2013 as a prelude to private development of properties lining the canals and a proposed additional marina in the Ellipse.
