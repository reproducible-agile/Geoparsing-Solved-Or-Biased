Lubao is a first class municipality in the province of Pampanga, Philippines. According to the May 2010 census, it has a population of 150,843 people. It is bounded by the municipalities of Guagua on the north, Sasmuan on the east, Floridablanca on the west and Orani, Bataan on the south. Located at the south-western part of Pampanga, it is noted for rice, sugar cane, fish, and sampaguita. The name Lubao was derived from the indigenous word “lubo” which means low. “Lubo” is characteristically muddy and flooded; later, the term evolved into “lubao,” which is the town’s present name. The Austronesian word is associated with the low or depressed elevation of the town. Hence, Lubao is synonymous to its ancient name Baba. Lubao is politically subdivided into 44 barangays. As the first Augustinian missionary center in Central and Northern Luzon, majority of the residents in Lubao are Roman Catholics. Lubao at present has six parishes : San Agustin Parish, Plaza, Lubao(oldest in Pampanga - Established 1572) San Roque Dau Parish, San Roque Dau, Lubao (established Oct.1, 1990)
