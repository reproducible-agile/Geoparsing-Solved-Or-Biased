San Rafael is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. It is one of the farthest municipalities of the Lempira department of Honduras. The best way to get to the municipality capital is via Santa B치rbara department, passing by El Nispero and San Jeronimo municipalities of this department. In the case of San Rafael, the cross-breed take the 80% of the population, with many people showing white skin. The rest is occupied for Indian descendants.

Villages: 9 Settlements: 53 It takes about 2.5 hours to get there from the city of Santa Barbara and the road is in much better conditions. The other way is via the city of Gracias, and it is about 60 km from it. It is necessary to take the common road to La Iguala and La Uni칩n, first passing by the "Puca" mountain and then some other steep mountains. The main disadvantage of this 2nd way is that the road needs to be repaired.The views of the coffee plantations are just awesome, and so are the rest of the landscapes provided by the big and steep mountains mentioned earlier in this article, this includes the views to Santa B치rbara department. The hospitality of its inhabitants is another feature, a proof of this is the sign that says: "En San Rafael, Nadie es Extra침o", meaning: "In San Rafael, Nobody is a stranger". There are some groceries stores and one hostel, but it is not a recommendable place to stay in.
