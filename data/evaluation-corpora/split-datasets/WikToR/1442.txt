Plymouth is a village in Huron and Richland counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 1,857 at the 2010 census. The Richland County portion of Plymouth is part of the Mansfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Huron County portion is part of the Norwalk Micropolitan Statistical Area. Plymouth was laid out in 1825. It was incorporated as a village in 1834. Plymouth was formerly the headquarters of the Plymouth Locomotive Works, a builder of industrial railroad locomotives. The factory closed in 1999. The company designed and built an automobile named Plymouth in the early part of the century, but it was not mass-produced, but there were trucks and tractors produced by Commercial Motor Truck Company under the Plymouth name in the same period. Later, Chrysler Motors developed the Plymouth Automobile Division, but thought the Ohio company had infringed on their name. A court battle ensued over the ownership of the name Plymouth, which Chrysler lost when it was determined the original Plymouth car preceded Chrysler's by several years. During the Great Depression, the Plymouth Locomotive Plant designed and built the famous Silver King (originally the Plymouth) tractor, a somewhat maligned favorite of local farmers and known for its fast road gear. The tractors were produced until the 1950s when it was sold to Mountain State Engineering in West Virginia and then discontinued. The village hosts the annual Silver King Festival during the first week of August when restored Silver Kings tractors from around the world are displayed.
