Bell (Hunsrück) is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis (district) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kastellaun, whose seat is in the like-named town. Bell’s Ortsteile are the main centre, also called Bell, and the outlying centres of Hundheim, Krastel, Leideneck, Wohnroth and Völkenroth along with the Blümlingshof and the Rothenberger Hof. In 1220, Bell had its first documentary mention in the directory of yearly payments to the Archbishopric of Trier, the liber annalium. Even so, Bell is a much older settlement. The name itself is pre-Germanic, being a Celtic word for a hill or a settlement in the heights. Grave finds near Bell, particularly the Wagon Grave of Bell from late Hallstatt times (about 500 BC), show that the area was settled by Celts. A Roman estate east of the church discovered in the mid 19th century and certified as a “ground monument”, and a Frankish manor just to its south in the cadastral area “In den Hupfeldern” (whose name refers to this estate; foundations of this manor were unearthed when the land was opened to development) give one some clue as to the village’s importance in the time when the Franks were taking over the land. Bell was also the main centre of a parish to which belonged Leideneck, Horn, Alterkülz and even the later castle and residence town of Kastellaun, now the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde. Neighbouring places with names ending in —heim and —bach (Hundheim, Michelbach) date from the time of the Frankish takeover (500–700) during the Migration Period (Völkerwanderung), and are therefore much younger than Bell. Places with names ending in —roth were established in the time of widespread woodland clearing in the Early Middle Ages. Bell also lay near the Celtic, later Roman, “high road”.
