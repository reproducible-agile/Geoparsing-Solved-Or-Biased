La Capilla is the name given to the southwestern part of the town of San Jerónimo in the municipality of San Martín de Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico. It is bordered by the Arroyo de la Calera to the west, and El Potrerito to the east. Along with El Potrerito, La Capilla was the property of the Barbosa family during the mid-19th century. The name of la capilla, which means "the chapel", was given to the area because of the long adobe chapel that once stood there. The chapel was probably built during the early 19th century, considering that it may have been the first religious structure built in San Jerónimo. The chapel was destroyed in the early 20th century to make way for an arable farmland. In the nearby creek Arroyo de la Calera are remains of a dam wall which also dates to the mid-19th century, and was probably used to recollect water for the cattle roaming in El Potrerito. Although no official population count has been attributed exclusively to the area, La Capilla's population is composed of approximately 40 inhabitants.
