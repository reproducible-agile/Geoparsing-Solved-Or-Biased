Villanueva is a second class municipality in the province of Misamis Oriental, Philippines. It is approximately 30–40 minutes away from the city of Cagayan de Oro. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 31,966 people. The presence of companies like Philippine Sinter Corporation (PSC), STEAG State Power Inc., Purina, and recent opening Coca Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. contributes to the municipality's income although it is largely agricultural. Villanueva celebrates the feast of the Our Lady of Guadalupe every 12 December. In 2015, it celebrated its ″1st Bongloy Festival″. Long before the advent of Spanish colonization, the place was originally named “Bongloy” by the natives called the Magahats, because of the three gigantic Bongloy trees that grew in the place where the Catholic church and town plaza stands today. In 1830, the mission of Jasaan, an adjacent town to the north, was to establish separation from Cagayan de Oro and evangelization to as far as the towns of Sumilao, Linabo and Malitbog in the province of Bukidnon. Its center of civilization and the first Church was at “Daanglungsod” which is now the Aplaya, Jasaan, where an old kota (watchtower) still exists, thus marked the birth of Christianity in Bongloy.
