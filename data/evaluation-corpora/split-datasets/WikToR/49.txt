San Francisco is a third income class municipality on Camotes Islands in the province of Cebu, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 47,357. In the 2013 election, it had 26,624 registered voters. San Francisco consists primarily of Pacijan Island (also known as Pajican Island), as well as the tiny Tulang islet just north of Pacijan. Both islands are part of the Camotes Islands group in the Camotes Sea (that also includes Poro Island and Ponson Island). They are located east of the main island of Cebu, south and west of Leyte and north of Bohol. Pacijan Island is about 14.75 kilometres (9.17 mi) long and 8.5 kilometres (5.3 mi) wide. A 1,400-metre (1,500 yd) causeway crosses the mangrove swamp to connect Pacijan and Poro Island. It was constructed during the Spanish era, to bridge the islands for easier trading and attending services in Poro church. San Francisco comprises 15 barangays: Just before Typhoon Yolanda struck in November 2013, the mayor of San Francisco ordered the evacuation of all the residents (approximately 1,000) to the main island. This was credited with saving their lives as all houses on the island (about 500) were completely destroyed.
