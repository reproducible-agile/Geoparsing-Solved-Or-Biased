Salisbury is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, New York, United States. The population was 12,093 at the 2010 census. Many but not all are housed in Levitt style homes adjacent to Eisenhower Park, formerly Salisbury Park. The region is also known by locals as South Westbury, and is located within the Westbury postal zone. It is served by the East Meadow School District. Salisbury is so named because it sits on a broad, flat section of the larger Hempstead Plains that reminded late 19th Century Long Islanders of the Salisbury Plain in England, where Stonehenge is located. The Long Island Motor Parkway bisected the Salisbury Plains running east to west across Salisbury, later Eisenhower Park. The route of the motor parkway is traced by a utility easement across the park, where it serves as a rough area separating two of the Nassau County park's three golf courses (the White and Blue Courses). The park is also the former site of the Meadowbrook Polo Club, which played host to the cream of pre-World War I Long Island society. The Polo Club was served by the former Central Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, terminating at a now-demolished station across Merrick Avenue to the immediate south of the park's main entrance.
