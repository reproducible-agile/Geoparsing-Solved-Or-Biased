Aurora is a town in Brookings County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 532 at the 2010 census. Aurora was platted in 1880. It was named after Aurora, Illinois, by a settler from that place. Aurora is located at 44°17′0″N 96°41′10″W (44.283215, -96.686048). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.46 square miles (1.19 km2), all of it land. Aurora has been assigned the ZIP code 57002, and the FIPS place code 02780. The sole two sports teams in Aurora are both baseball teams, American Legion Baseball Post 230 & the Aurora A's. Both exist under the Aurora Baseball Association and play their home games at Aurora Field, located two blocks west of the city water tower. Although Post 230 is classified as a district 1A team (explained below), it plays the majority of its games against "B" division opponents. However, if it wishes to compete at the district tournament, it must compete against its intra-district 1 opponents, which are Brookings, Aberdeen, Watertown, and Huron. The reason Post 230 is considered a district 1A team is because it plays within the area designated as district 1 and obtains at least a portion of its players from neighboring Brookings High School (a school possessing an "A" enrollment status under American Legion by-laws). The team has been an installation in Aurora since 2002 and its colors are blue and white, gray, and/or black.
