Valle de Guadalupe (Valley of Guadalupe), or Francisco Zarco is a village located in the Ensenada Municipality, Baja California, Mexico, 20 km (14 mi) north of the city of Ensenada. The census of 2010 reported a population of 2,664 inhabitants. The community was founded in 1834 by Dominican missionary Félix Caballero as Misión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe del Norte, making it the last mission established in the Californias. Caballero had to abandon the mission in 1840, under attacks from the indigenous peoples. From 1905-1910, a mixture of Spiritual Christian faiths from South Russia, mostly Pryguny, settled in 4 farming colonies near Ensenada, Baja California Norte Territory, Mexico. Guadalupe was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in 1905. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various faiths. They also rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches. A few other immigrants from Russia lived in Ensenada city. Most moved to California during WWII to join more prosperous relatives and work in the war industries. Most of those who remain, intermarried and live in Ensenada and Tijuana.
