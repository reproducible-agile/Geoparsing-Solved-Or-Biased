Georgetown is a home rule-class city in Scott County, Kentucky, in the United States. The 2014 population was 31,653 per the United States Census Bureau. It is the 9th-largest city by population in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It is the seat of its county. It was originally called Lebanon when founded by Rev. Elijah Craig and was renamed in 1790 in honor of President George Washington. It is the home of Georgetown College, a private liberal arts college. Georgetown is part of the Lexington-Fayette, KY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city's growth began in the mid-1980s, when Toyota built Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, its first wholly owned United States plant, in the city. The plant, which currently builds the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Venza, Avalon, and Lexus ES automobiles, opened in 1988. It is the largest building in terms of acres covered under one building in the United States, with over 200 acres (0.8 km2) occupied. The city previously served as the training camp for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. Native peoples have lived along the banks of Elkhorn Creek in what is now Scott County for at least 15,000 years. European exploration can be dated to a June 1774 surveying expedition from Fincastle County, Virginia, led by Colonel John Floyd. For his military service, he was granted a claim of 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) in the area by the state of Virginia. He named it Royal Spring but did not settle it. John McClellan was the first to settle the area and established McClellan's Station there in 1775, but the compound was abandoned following an Indian attack on December 29, 1776.
