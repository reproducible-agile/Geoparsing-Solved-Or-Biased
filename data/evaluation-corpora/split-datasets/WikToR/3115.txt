Camden is a city in and the county seat of Ouachita County in the southern part of the U.S. state of Arkansas. Long an area of Native-American villages, the French also made a permanent settlement here because of its advantageous location above the Ouachita River. In 2000, Camden had a population of 13,154, but it lost 7.4 percent of its residents and recorded 12,183 in 2010. The municipality in 2010 was 56 percent African American. Camden is the principal city of the Camden Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Ouachita and Calhoun counties. Indigenous peoples of various cultures had lived along the rivers of Arkansas for thousands of years and created complex societies. Mississippian culture peoples built massive earthwork mounds along the Ouachita River beginning about 1000 AD. In 1783, this area was part of New France. A French trader named Fabre settled on a bluff above the Ouachita River and called the settlement Ã‰core Fabre (Faber's Bluff). This was the first European permanent settlement of what would become Camden. He traded with the Ouachita and other American Indians who inhabited the area.
