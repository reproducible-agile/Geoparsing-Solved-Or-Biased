Las Animas is the Statutory City that is the county seat and the only incorporated municipality in Bent County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 2410 at the 2010 United States Census. Las Animas is located in southeast Colorado east of Pueblo, near the historic Bent's Fort. Las Animas is located on the Arkansas River, just west of its confluence with the Purgatoire River (or "Purgatory River"). A famous legend says that the town and the Purgatoire River were named for a group of conquistadors, probably part of Coronado's expedition, who died without the last rites sacrament of a priest. According to Catholic belief, their souls would go to Purgatory as a result. The original Spanish name for Las Animas ("The Souls," in Spanish) was purported to be La Ciudad de Las Animas Perdidos en Purgatorio, "The city of lost souls in Purgatory." According to the book Trinidad, Colorado Territory by Morris F. Taylor, this explanation is not consistent with Spanish Catholic belief. Souls in purgatory are not lost; they are in limbo for a short time of purification before ascending to heaven. According to Taylor, the French developed the connotation of souls in Purgatory.
