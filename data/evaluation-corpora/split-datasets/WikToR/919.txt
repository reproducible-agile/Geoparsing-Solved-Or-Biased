Hampton is a community located in the municipality of Clarington, Ontario, Canada. It originally served as the township office headquarters for Darlington Township until 1974 when it was annexed by The Town of Newcastle (now Clarington). Hampton was founded by Henry Elliot in 1840, who opened the first mill here in the former Darlington Township. At first it was called "Elliot's Mill" and then by 1848 just "Millsville". Other former names have included: "Hog's Hollow" and "Shantytown". With the opening of the post office the name "Hampton" was chosen, as it was an abbreviation of Henry Elliot's birthplace, Kirkhampton in Cornwall, England. Hampton has two schools: Hampton Junior Public School which goes from junior kindergarten to grade 3, and M. J. Hobbs Senior Public School which covers grades 4-8. It has two convenience stores, one of which has an LCBO and The Beer Store located inside, two auto garages, one local pizza store, two coffee shops, and Paddy's Market (a new and used appliances store). Hampton is also home to the Darlington sports arena.
