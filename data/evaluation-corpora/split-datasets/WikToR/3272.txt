Inglewood is located 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) southeast of New Plymouth on State Highway 3, close to Mount Taranaki/Egmont. The town lies 200 metres (660 ft) above sea level. It is a small town servicing a mainly dairy farming region. Although close to New Plymouth, the town has the usual stores and services for town and country. Inglewood was named by Philip Colin Threkeld for Inglewood Forest in Cumberland, United Kingdom. The settlement was founded in 1873, and its name rapidly progressed from Moatown to Milton, before being renamed to Inglewood in 1875 to avoid confusion with Milton in the South Island. A number of buildings are listed by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Of those, the Railway Station and Yard is the only one listed as Category I. The Shoe Store Building on the corner of Rata and Richmond Streets is one of eight listed as Category II.
