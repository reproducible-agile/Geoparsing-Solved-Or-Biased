Qala (Maltese: Il-Qala, pronounced Aala in English) is a village on the island of Gozo, Malta, with a population of 2284 as of March 2014. Nearby is Ħondoq ir-Rummien, a coastline with salt pans and caves popular with snorkellers and divers. Qala is first referred to in a fifteenth-century portolan preserved at the Vatican Library. It has taken its name from the qala or port of Ħondoq ir-Rummien. It is the easternmost village of Gozo and has been inhabited since early times. The development of the present settlement began in the second half of the seventeenth century. It is a pleasant and rural place with many natural and historic attractions. Though Qala is the farthest village from Gozo's capital, Victoria, it is the closest to the rest of the Maltese archipelago, and the rocky hillsides of Qala enjoy an unobstructed view of the islands of Malta and Comino. Breath taking scenes can be enjoyed, among other places, from the Qala Belvedere and from the small courtyard in front of the church known as Il-Madonna tal-Blat (Our Lady of the Rocks). This church faces Comino and legend has it that it was built so that the people of that island could follow Holy Mass from across the straits when rough weather precluded a priest from crossing there.
