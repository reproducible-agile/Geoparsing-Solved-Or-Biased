Shelton is a suburb of Shrewsbury in Shropshire, England, described by the Pevsner Architectural Guides as "Shrewsbury's principal interwar suburb." It was once a village of its own, but the town of Shrewsbury has grown steadily in the area since the 1950s. It has a Church of England parish church, Christ Church (built 1854) which serves a parish formally known as Shelton and Oxon. Severn Trent Water has a major site on Welshpool Road in Shelton, consisting of offices and a water treatment works. Shelton has a cricket club whose ground is adjacent to the former Shelton Hospital (see below), with which the club has strong historic associations. The team played in the Shropshire Premier Cricket League until the league was wound up after the 2011 season. In 2012 Shelton played in the Premier Division of the newly formed Shropshire County Cricket League but were relegated to Division 1 at the end of that season. In 2015 Shelton finished second in Division 1, gaining promotion to the Premier Division and ending a spell of three years outside the top division.
