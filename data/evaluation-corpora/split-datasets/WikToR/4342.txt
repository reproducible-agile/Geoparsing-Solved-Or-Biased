It is home to Temple Mountain State Reservation, and formerly home to Temple Mountain Ski Area. The area was first called Peterborough Slip, which included what is now Sharon. In 1758, Maj. Ephraim Heald and his wife Sarah, moved to Temple, They, along with his brother, Dea. Peter Heald, and a cousin, Oliver Heald, were among the first settlers. Peter Heald is generally considered to be the founder of Temple, and his child, Peter, was the first white child born in the town. In 1768, it was incorporated by colonial Governor John Wentworth, who named it after his lieutenant governor, John Temple. The town of Temple, Maine was in turn named for it.
