Washington is a town in the City of Sunderland, in Tyne and Wear, England, and part of historic County Durham. Washington is located geographically at an equal distance from the centres of Newcastle, Durham and Sunderland, hence it has close ties to all three cities. Washington was designated a new town in 1964; it expanded dramatically, by the creation of new villages and the absorption of areas of Chester-le-Street, to house overspill population from surrounding cities. At the 2011 census, its urban subdivision (which contains the neighboring settlement of New Herrington) had a population of 67,085. In 2001 the population of Washington itself was 55,454, compared with 55,196 a decade later, which is a decrease of 258 people. The population decrease is a characteristic shared with the nearby city of Sunderland as well as some areas in the Metropolitan borough of Gateshead. Early references appear around 1096 in Old English as Wasindone. The etymological origin is disputed and there are several proposed theories for how the name "Washington" came about. Early interpretations included Wasindone (people of the hill by the stream, 1096), or Wassyngtona (settlement of Wassa's people, 1183).
