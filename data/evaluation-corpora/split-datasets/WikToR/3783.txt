Elgin (/ˈɛlɡᵻn/ with a hard g, unlike Elgin, Illinois) is a city in Bastrop and Travis Counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 8,135 at the 2010 census. The city is a suburb of Austin, and is part of the Greater Austin metropolitan area. Elgin is also known as the Sausage Capital of Texas and the Brick Capital of the Southwest, due to the presence of three operating brickyards in the mid-20th century (two of which are open to this date). Elgin is located 25 miles (40 km) east of downtown Austin and 18 miles (29 km) north of Bastrop, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 290 and State Highway 95. Most of the city lies in Bastrop County, with a portion extending westward into Travis and Williamson Counties. Most of north Elgin is built on blackland prairie soil. Elgin is served by the Elgin Independent School District, which covers more than 168 square miles (440 km2) in portions of Bastrop, Lee, Williamson, and Travis Counties, and provides educational facilities and resources to meet the needs of more than 4,000 students as of 2010. Austin Community College opened its ACC Elgin branch in the city in 2013.
