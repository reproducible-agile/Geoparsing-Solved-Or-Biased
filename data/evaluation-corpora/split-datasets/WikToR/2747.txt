Perth is a town in northern Tasmania, Australia. It lies 20 km south of Launceston, on the Midland Highway. The town has a population of 2,239 and is averaging a 1% increase per year (2001 census). Perth is part of the Northern Midlands Council. Federal Lyons MHR Eric Hutchinson also has an office in the town. At the 2006 census, Perth had a population of 2,239. It is the first major town out of Launceston on the route to Hobart, and also serves as a major junction for people bypassing Launceston on the route from Hobart to the northwest of the state. Like nearby Longford, Perth is a historic town with many buildings dating back to the early 19th century. In 1837, five years after the practice ceased in England, the body of John McKay was gibbetted near the spot where he murdered Joseph Wilson near Perth. There was great outcry, but the body was not removed until an acquaintance of Wilson passed the spot and horrified by the spectacle of McKay's rotting corpse, pleaded with the authorities to remove it.
