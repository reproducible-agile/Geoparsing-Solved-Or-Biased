Kew, New South Wales is a small town in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia in the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council local government area. Kew is one of the communities that make up the Camden Haven district of Port Macquarie-Hastings. Kew is located at the intersection of Nancy Bird Walton Drive (the former Pacific Highway) and Ocean Drive, the road to the larger town of Laurieton. Kew has a visitor information centre, a pub, a post office, a small police station, a motel, a roadhouse and a general store. Traffic congestion along this stretch of the highway led to the construction of a new dual carriageway bypass of Kew to the east of the township as part of a highway upgrade from Coopernook to Herons Creek. Construction commenced in November 2007 and was completed in December 2009. The largest school in the district, Camden Haven High School, is located 2 km east of Kew on Ocean Drive. Kew is home to the Big Axe. Kew Bowling Club is located on Camden Haven Golf Course, 100 metres west of the Pacific Highway traffic lights. Kew is served by several daily coaches along the Pacific Highway, and three NSW TrainLink XPT services at Kendall railway station on the North Coast Line 2 km to the west.
