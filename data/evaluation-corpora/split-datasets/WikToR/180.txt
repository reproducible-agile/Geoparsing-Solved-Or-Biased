San Luis is a second class municipality in the province of Aurora, Philippines. The town has almost the same area as Metro Manila. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 25,276 people. Between 1818 and 1902, the Province of Aurora, then a district of “ El Principe”, Nueva Ecija consisted only of Baler and Casiguran. The four (4) other existing municipalities were just mission villages like the San Jose de Casecnan (now Maria Aurora), Dipaculao, Dilasag and Ditale. While what is now the municipality of San Luis was a barrio of Baler adjacent to the old barrios of Real, Bacong, Ditumabo and Zarah. It was named after the patron Saint “ San Luis Rey de Francia”. In the Philippines Revolution of 1898, the five barrios became the hot beds of insurgency. The situation was aggravated when the insurrectos attacked the cazadores living in those areas. Since then, these places became famous and significant spots in the northern part of the then Tayabas province. On 9 December 1941, the locality suffered heavy casualties when the Japanese Imperial forces bombarded it. This caused the people to flee their homes and settle in nearby mountains of Dibalo and Dicaloyungan. From there, they organized and formed a guerilla group called “205th Squadron” which later became instrumental in liberating the province against the Japanese invading forces by the local Filipino soldiers and the recognized guerrillas in 1945.
