Kozlovo (Russian: Козлово) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Konakovsky District of Tver Oblast, Russia, located close the right bank of the Shosha River (the Ivankovo Reservoir). Population: 3,884 (2010 Census); 4,388 (2002 Census); 4,368 (1989 Census). The village of Kozlovo was first mentioned in the 16th century. After 1781, it belonged to Klinsky Uyezd of Moscow Governorate. In 1857, a carpet factory was open by merchant Flanden. The factory served for a long time as the main employer in Kozlovo. On July 12 1929, Moscow Governorate was abolished, and the area was transferred to Moscow Oblast. Uyezds were abolished as well, and Zavidovsky District, with the administrative center in Novozavidovsky, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. Kozlovo was included into Zavidovsky District. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Zavidovsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In November and December 1941, during World War II, Kozlovo was occupied by German troops. In 1958, Kozlovo was granted urban-type settlement status. On November 14, 1960 the district was abolished and merged into Konakovsky District. On February 13, 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Konakovsky District was merged into Kalininsky District, but on January  12, 1965 it was re-established. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.
