At the 2011 census, Windsor had a population of 7,069. Windsor is bounded by Dandenong Road, St Kilda Road, Williams Road and High Street. It is often incorrectly referred to as Prahran, Windsor's northern neighbour. In the past, Windsor was within the City of Prahran's boundaries and many institutions still refer to this. Windsor was named after Windsor, Berkshire. Known at first as Prahran South, its name was changed to Windsor in 1891. A Windsor Post Office opened in 1856, but was renamed St Kilda in 1858. The Windsor Post Office in the area opened in 1886. Although Stonnington's smallest suburb, Windsor has its own bank, along with a growing number of independent clothing stores, restaurants, bars, lounges and caf√©s. Windsor contains a diverse mix of housing, including medium density apartments, Victorian terrace housing, hi-rise public housing tower and semi-detached cottages.
