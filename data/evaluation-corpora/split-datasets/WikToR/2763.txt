Ames is a town in southeastern Major County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 239 at the 2010 census. This was a 20.1 percent increase from 199 at the 2000 census.

Ames was founded at the opening of the Cherokee Outlet on September 16, 1893. It was initially named Hoyle, for a nearby creek. The Blackwell, Enid and Southwestern Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) constructed a line from Blackwell in Kay County to Darrow in Blaine County, that passed through the community. On January 4, 1902, it was named for Henry S. Ames, a railroad official. Ames had a population of 278 at the 1920 census and 332 at the 1940 census, its peak population.
