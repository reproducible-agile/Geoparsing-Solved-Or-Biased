Guildford is a small settlement situated on the Loddon River, 130 kilometres (81 mi) north-west of Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia. It is located on the Midland Highway between Daylesford and Castlemaine. The population recorded at the 2011 census was 245. Facilities in the town include a post office (in a building dating from 1901), hotel, community hall and a general store. It is thought that the town was named after Guildford in England. The area was known as Yarrayne to the original inhabitants of the area, the Jajowarrung people. The first European to explore the area was Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836. By the 1840s pastoral runs had been established and, in the following decade, gold miners flocked to the area during the rush at the Mount Alexander goldfields. The largest encampment of Chinese miners in Victoria (estimates vary from 5000-6000 individual miners) was situated at the junction of the Loddon River and Campbells Creek. Tensions ran high between the white miners and the Chinese which erupted in numerous local conflicts. This anti-Chinese hostility, combined with discriminatory taxation against Chinese miners, saw the Chinese population dwindle and eventually all but disappear by the end of the gold rush.
