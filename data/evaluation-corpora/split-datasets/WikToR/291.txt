Tara (太良町, Tara-chō) is a town and peninsula located in Fujitsu District, Saga Prefecture, Japan. Tara is bordered by Isahaya, Ōmura, Kashima and the Ariake Sea. On a clear day, it is possible to see the mountains across the sea. Tara includes Mount Tara and Mount Kyoga, which are two of the highest mountains in Kyūshū and part of the Tara Mountains. Tara is composed of two traditional — and to a lesser extent, linguistic — sections, which were once independent towns: Tara (多良) and Ōura (大浦). Tara is located quite close to the Kashima Gatalympics, which takes place near Hizen-Iida station. Ōura harbor is the main port of entry via sea. Famous, tourist, and historic sites of note include: Kinsenji (temple) Once had influence on shrines throughout Kyūshū, though it is now literally a shell of its former glory (see legends below) Takezaki Kanze Onji (temple) Culturally one of the most influential areas in Tara (see festivals, below) Tara Takezaki onsen One of the few sources of tourism in modern times
