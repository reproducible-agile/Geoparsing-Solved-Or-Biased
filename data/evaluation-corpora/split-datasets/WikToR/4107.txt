Tain is a village in the Jhunjhunu district, India. It is part of the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan. Tain lies 15 km to the north of Mandawa town in the Jhunjhunu district, bounded by the districts of Sikar and Churu. It is a former estate of 12 villages founded in 1761 by Thakur Sahib Salem Singhji the grandson of Maharao Sardul Singh, a ruler of Jhunjhunu. Tain estate has a very turbulent history going back more than 250 years. There have been many upheavals, as is evident from the state of its historical monuments. The Shekhawati Brigade, a cavalry regiment under the command of Major Henry Forster, inflicted major damage on Tain's fort in the 1830s. The regiment was formed and raised to specifically target and bring to book the so-called "Rogue" rulers, chieftains and Thikanas of Shekhawati, who refused to pay allegiance to the Jaipur State and its British overlords. The majority of the Shekhawat rulers were opposed to their cousins, the larger Jaipur State and the British. Tain village has a population of around 5,000. It is primarily divided into three parts, according to an old custom of social hierarchy: Tain Garh is home mainly to Rajputs; Tain Johad is home to Jats and other peasant farming communities; and Tain Baas has a mainly Qaimkhani population.
