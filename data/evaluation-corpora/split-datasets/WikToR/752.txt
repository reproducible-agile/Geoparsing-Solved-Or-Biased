Windsor is a small historic unincorporated community located within Robbinsville Township (known as Washington Township until 2007) in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. The area is served as United States Postal Service ZIP Code 08561. There are approximately 50 homes in the area, and as of the 2010 United States Census, the population for ZIP Code Tabulation Area 08561 was 226. The community, covering 570 acres (230 ha), was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Earliest mention of the local area in the 17th century refers to it as a wilderness with several Native American camps. Founded in 1818, it was named Centerville because it was the geographical center of the state. Until then, adjacent heavily wooded lands were called Magrilla (origins unknown). In 1814, after the completion of the Bordentown and South Amboy stagecoach turnpike, William McKnight, director of the turnpike company, built a tavern at the intersection of the turnpike and present-day Windsor-Perrineville Road. A major thruway between New York and Philadelphia, the turnpike replaced Old York Road, which started out as a Native-American path prior to European settlement. In 1816 the local section of the stagecoach turnpike between New York and Philadelphia ran along Main Street. In late 1831, the Camden and Amboy Railroad was constructed through Centerville. The village became a stopover for rail travelers, and a thriving center for the bountiful farms and mills which serviced the growing population. It quickly became the largest village between Yardville (Sand Town) and Hightstown, and was renamed "Windsor" in 1846 to avoid any confusion with a Centerville post office in Hunterdon County.
