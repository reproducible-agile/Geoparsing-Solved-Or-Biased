Chamba is a town and nagar panchayat in Tehri Garhwal district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is situated at a junction of roads connecting Mussoorie and Rishikesh with the Tehri Dam reservoir and New Tehri. Its nearby tourist places are Dhanaulti, Surkanda Devi Temple, Ranichauri, New Tehri, and Kanatal, halfway between Chamba and Dhanaulti. About 50 km from Mussoorie, the small hill town of Chamba, Uttaranchal, is another of those destinations yet unknown to most tourists and therefore unspoilt and fresh like a daisy for the lucky few who venture out seeking new places to explore and enjoy. Chamba is situated at an altitude of 1600m above sea level. There are pleasant forests of pine and deodar trees, with some good views. Unlike Mussoorie, this place is fairly quiet and picturesque, hence an excellent place to relax and wash off the city blues. One can reach Chamba in about 7-8 hrs from Delhi via Hardwar, Rishikesh and Narendranagar (290 km). One can also combine a stay at Chamba with a visit to Mussoorie or Dhanolti and reach via Dehradun, Mussoorie and Dhanolti.
