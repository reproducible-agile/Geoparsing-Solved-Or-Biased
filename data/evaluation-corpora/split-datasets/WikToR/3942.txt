Lade (Old Norse: Hlaðir) is a community in Trondheim, Norway. It is located on a peninsula north-east of the city centre, north of the community of Lademoen. It was the site of historic farm, Lade gaard. Lade is located in the eastern part of Trondheim, bordering the Trondheimsfjord, an important waterway dating to the Viking Age. Historically the Lade farm in Trondheim (Lade Storgård i Trondheim) was the seat of the Jarls of Lade (Ladejarler) who ruled Trøndelag and Hålogaland. The Jarls of Lade were a dynasty of Norwegian rulers, influential from the 9th century to the 11th century. The Lade farm remained crown property until sometime in the Middle Ages when it was operated by the Bakke Abbey. The abbey was dissolved in 1537 in the course of the Reformation at which time the site became crown property. Lade Church dates from ca. 1190. The present farm buildings were erected in 1811 at the direction of Hilmar Meincke Krohg. The farm was purchased by the City of Trondheim in 1917. During the period 1922-1960, Norges Teachers College was in the buildings. Lade farm was acquired by the Reitangruppen in 1992. The buildings were restored and became their headquarters in 1995.
