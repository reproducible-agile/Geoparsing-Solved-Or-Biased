Hillsboro is a town in Caroline County, Maryland. The population was 161 at the 2010 United States Census. Daffin House and St. Paul's Episcopal Church were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Hillsboro is the oldest town in Caroline County. Evidence shows that as early as 1694 there was an Anglican chapel-of-ease located on the Eastern bank of the Tuckahoe. Little is known life at the Tuckahoe Bridge until the close of the Revolution. Commercially Hillsboro was the site of a tobacco warehouse, one or more general stores, a shoe factory, and a tavern, but its chief claim to fame lies within the spiritual and cultural fields. The first newspaper to be published in Caroline County was published in Hillsboro in 1831 by Lucas Brothers. Hillsboro previously known as Tuckahoe Bridge was named in the honor of Lord Hillsboro of the Calvert Family. In 1804 there was a fever epidemic in Hillsboro then again in 1816; both occurred in the same house the Seller residence. Hillsboro was the site of the Tri-County fair and the meeting place of Congressional Conventions.
