Weston is a city in Platte County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,641 at the 2010 census. Lewis and Clark Expedition camped out near the location of today's city hall. Weston was the oldest settlement in the Platte Purchase of 1836 and was therefore also the farthest western settlement (thus, "West Town") in the United States until the admission of Texas as a state in 1845. Another suggested origin is related to a story about a discharged US Army dragoon by the name of Joseph Moore. He bought the land and then had First Sergeant Tom Weston of D Company, First Dragoons, stationed at Fort Leavenworth across the Missouri River, lay out a town plan. It is this individual the town is named for. William Buffalo Bill Cody was at one time a resident of Weston, and the town was a major "jumping off" point for the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush. Weston was at one time the second largest port on the Missouri river, surpassing both Kansas City and St. Joseph; however, a flood in 1881 shifted the river into an old channel some 2 miles away. In 1850 over 265 steamboats a year docked at the Port of Weston.
