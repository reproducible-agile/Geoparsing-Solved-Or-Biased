Madison County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, the population was 73,442. Its county seat is Wampsville. The county is named after James Madison, fourth President of the United States of America, and was first formed in 1806. Madison County is part of the Syracuse, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area. Indigenous peoples had occupied areas around Oneida Lake for thousands of years. The historic Oneida Nation is an Iroquoian-speaking people who emerged as a culture in this area about the fourteenth century and dominated the territory. They are one of the Five Nations who originally comprised the Iroquois Confederacy or Haudenosaunee. English colonists established counties in eastern present-day New York State in 1683; at the time, the territory of the present Madison County was considered part of Albany County, with the city of Albany located on the Hudson River. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State around Albany as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. It was claimed by the English but largely occupied by the Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga and Mohawk, who had the territory in the central Mohawk Valley, as well as Mahican near the Hudson River. On July 3, 1766 the English organized Cumberland County, and on March 16, 1770 they organized Gloucester County, both containing territory now included in the state of Vermont.
