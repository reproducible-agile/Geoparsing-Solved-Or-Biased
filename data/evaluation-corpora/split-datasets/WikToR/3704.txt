Howard County is a county located in the U.S. state of Missouri, with its southern border made by the Missouri River. As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,144. Its county seat is Fayette. The county was organized January 23, 1816 and named for Benjamin Howard, the first Governor of the Missouri Territory. On the north bank of the Missouri River, Howard County was settled primarily by migrants from the Upper Southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. They brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them, and quickly started cultivating commodity crops similar to those in Middle Tennessee and Kentucky: hemp and tobacco. Howard was one of several counties settled mostly by Southerners along the Missouri River in the central part of the state. Given their culture and traditions, this area became known as Little Dixie and Howard County was at its heart. Following the 1848 revolutions in Germany, many German immigrants also settled in this area. Due to the reliance on slave labor, in 1860 slaves made up 25 percent or more of the county's population. Howard County residents generally supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. After Reconstruction, whites imposed Jim Crow laws and segregation. There were five lynchings between 1891 and 1914: all the victims—Olli Truxton, Frank Embree, Thomas Hayden, Arthur McNeal, and Dallas Shields—were African-American men. The rate of lynchings of blacks was higher in the Deep South, during what is considered the nadir of United States race relations.
