Knox County is a county located in Indiana in the United States. It was one of two original counties created in the old Northwest Territory in 1790 and was reduced to its present size in 1817. As of 2010, the population was 38,440. The county seat is Vincennes. In 1790, Winthrop Sargent, Secretary of Northwest Territory, organized the first Indiana county, Knox County. It was named for Major General Henry Knox, U.S. Secretary of War. Knox County was one of the original counties of the Northwest Territory and was created prior to the formation of the Indiana Territory. When it was created, Knox County extended to Canada and encompassed all or part of the present states of Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio. When the Illinois Territory was formed in 1809, the portions of Knox County beyond the Wabash River became a part of Illinois. Many of Knox Country townships and lots were surveyed with the French system, which goes towards non-cardinal compass points. Knox and Clark counties are the only ones laid out in this fashion. The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.
