Agua Fria is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. It is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,051 at the 2000 census. Agua Fria Village is a "Traditional Historic Community" (THC) as designated by the Santa Fe Board of County Commissioners in 1995 and subsequent Santa Fe County Ordinance #1996-16, as allowed by State Statute (3-7-1.1 and 3-2-3 (C) NMSA 1978). Agua Fria is located at 35°39′33″N 106°0′45″W (35.659143, -106.012412). The traditional boundaries of the Village are from Camino Carlos Rael (west boundary of Frenchy's Field Park) on the east to San Felipe Road on the west (rejected Cienguilla Grant boundary), to Arroyo de los Chamisos on the south (present day Santa Fe Place Mall), to Arroyo de los Frijoles on the north (the arroyo is a City of Santa Fe walking trail, but it might be described as Las Companas subdivision---just north of State Road 599). The present day THC boundaries are much smaller (basically Siler Road on east, Lopez lane and Jemez Road on west, Rufina Street on south and State Road 599 on north).
