Jefferson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2010 census, the population was 51,407. Its county seat is Dandridge. Jefferson County is part of the Morristown, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Knoxville-Morristown-Sevierville, TN Combined Statistical Area. Jefferson County was established on June 11, 1792, by William Blount, Governor of the Southwest Territory. It had been a part of Caswell County during the State of Franklin period (1784â€“1789). Its county seat, Dandridge, was settled in 1783. On the eve of the Civil War, Jefferson County, like most other counties in mountainous East Tennessee, was opposed to secession. In Tennessee's Ordinance of Secession referendum on June 8, 1861, Jefferson County voters rejected secession by a margin of 1,987 to 603. A railroad bridge at Strawberry Plains was among those targeted by the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy in November 1861. This led to internal conflict in the area throughout the war, with men from the county enlisting in both of the rival armies. Jefferson County's current mayor is Alan Palmieri. The county has 21 commissioners, two from each of the ten districts, with White Pine electing three.
