Wawa is an unincorporated community located in Delaware County, Pennsylvania in Greater Philadelphia, partially in Middletown Township and partially in Chester Heights Borough. In the 1700s people from Philadelphia and New Jersey settled Wawa due to the community's abundance of water. Various mills, including gristmills and paper mills, opened on area creeks. Wawa was originally known as Pennellton and Grubb's Bridge. When Edward Worth built an estate here, he named it "Wawa", the Ojibwe word for "wild goose", because of the flocks of geese attracted to the still water behind Lenni milldam. The name had been transferred to the town by 1884. Forge Hill was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 1973. Cynthia Mayer of the Philadelphia Inquirer said in 1989 that there was "the indignity of being from a town now associated with a convenience store. Unlike, say, Hershey, Pa. - or Wawa's cherished dairying past - outsiders now tend to associate Wawa with Chee-tos, emergency toilet paper errands and Super Squeezers." Eight weeks before June 15, 1989, Wawa Inc. announced that it planned to expand its Wawa dairy, which is located in Middletown Township. Walter Kirby, head of the Wawa Farms Association, alerted residents of the Wawa community, and they appeared in large numbers at a meeting. Kirby said that residents did not want the dairy to expand, but they preferred having a dairy to other types of development.
