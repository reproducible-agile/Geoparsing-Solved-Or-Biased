Cortez is an unincorporated community in Merced County, California. It is located on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad 11.5 miles (19 km) northwest of Atwater, at an elevation of 141 feet (43 m). Founding Some of California's early agricultural colonies owe their birth to the idealism of Abiko Kyutaro. Born in Niigata Prefecture Japan in 1865, he was raised by his grandfather in less than favorable economic conditions. At seventeen he moved to Tokyo with hopes jumping on a ship to America, but he ended up working there for a few years instead. During this time he became devout Christian and then came to America as a student in 1885, like several other initial Japanese immigrants. A decade later, Abiko became a somewhat of a successful businessman and began his personal mission to aid other fellow Japanese in settling in the United States. In 1899 his news paper entitled Nichibei Shimbun became the most prominent Japanese newspaper. The paper took on issues such as restrictions on Japanese immigration and education discrimination. Abikoâ€™s paper not only helped publicize issues important to Japanese Americans, but it also created ties among newly formed Japanese communities. As Abiko became a prominent leader in the Japanese American community, he formed three new colonies: Yamato Colony in Livingston in 1907, Cressey in 1918, and Cortez in 1919.
