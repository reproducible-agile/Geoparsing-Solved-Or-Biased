Belmont is a formerly separate village in County Durham, England that is now incorporated into, and a suburb of, Durham City. It was initially a coal mining village and is situated to the north-east of the city centre, just east of the A1(M) motorway. The village forms the nucleus of the Belmont parish. The flats at Minster Court (at the south side of Buckinghamshire Road) were built on land formerly belonging to Ravensflatt Farm. The secondary school located here Belmont Community School was originally planned to be turned into an academy. However, a large portion of the staff protested against this, causing the school to stay the same. The Church was bombed in the Second World War because the German pilots mistook it for Durham Cathedral (in the fog). The village is on the bus route from Sunderland to Durham. There are three pubs, two school sites and a church, St. Mary Magdelene. Since 1994 Belmont has been the site of New Ferens Park, home of Unibond League (and former Football League) club Durham City AFC. It also contains Chevely Park shopping centre which includes shops such as Spar, Cooplands and other food establishments.
