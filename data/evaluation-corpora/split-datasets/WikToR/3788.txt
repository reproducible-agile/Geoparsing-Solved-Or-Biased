Johnstown is a community in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, in eastern Ontario, Canada, part of the township of Edwardsburgh/Cardinal. It is located at the Canadian terminus of the Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge and at the southern terminus of Highway 416 and Highway 16. In 1673, the French settlers, along with the allied Natives, built a storehouse in modern-day Johnstown. It was situated on the shores of Old Breeches River, now called Johnstown Creek. The storehouse was used to hold supplies headed upriver to fur trading posts such as Fort Frontenac (Now, Kingston). It was in use until 1758. Fort de Lévis was a French fort which was located on Chimney Island (Formerly known as Isle Royale), in the St. Lawrence River just off of the shores of Johnstown. It was built in 1760 in preparation for a British attack, as an attempt to block their advance down river. The original design, created by Francis de Gaston, Chevalier de Levis intended for the fort to be built with stone walls, have 200 guns, and house 2,500 troops. In contrast, the fort was small and made of wood, with five cannons and about 200 soldiers. In the same year it was built, the fort was captured by the British in the Battle of the Thousand Islands.
