Kanash (Russian: Кана́ш; Chuvash: Канаш, Kanaš, lit. soviet) is a town in the Chuvash Republic, Russia, located at a major railway junction 76 kilometers (47 mi) from Cheboksary, the capital of the republic. Population: 45,607 (2010 Census); 50,593 (2002 Census); 54,585 (1989 Census). It was founded in 1891. Between 1891 and 1925 it was called Shikhrany (Шихраны). The town's history is closely linked to the development of the railway. The Moscow–Kazan line was completed, except for the Imperatorsky Romanovsky railway bridge across Volga, in December 1884 by private Moscow Ryazan Railway Company which was renamed to Moscow Kazan Railway Company on July 11, 1891, which provided all train service in the area up to 1918, when all the remaining private railways were nationalized by the Bolsheviks. The opening of the station, which was then surrounded by woodland, provided a convenient production point for the timber industry, and windmills were built in the area. In 1911, there were more than forty trading firms in Shikhrany. In 1912, a primary school was opened, and in 1914—a middle school. In 1919, Shikhrany station became a railway junction, when the Arzamas–Shikhrany line, which had been under construction from 1914, when the last section was completed from the Tsarkli River bridge to Shihrany, and opened to full traffic. The line had been in restricted use with limited car loads since summer 1917.
