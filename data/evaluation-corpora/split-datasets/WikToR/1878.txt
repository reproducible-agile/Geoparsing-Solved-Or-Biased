Salisbury /ˈsɔːlzbəri/ is a city in southeastern Maryland, United States. It is the county seat of Wicomico County and the largest city in the state's Eastern Shore region. The population was 30,343 at the 2010 census. Salisbury is the principal city of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is the commercial hub of the Delmarva Peninsula and calls itself "The Comfortable Side of Coastal". Salisbury is located near several major cities: Baltimore 106 miles (171 km); Washington, D.C. 119 miles (192 km), Philadelphia 128 miles (206 km), and Wilmington 96 miles (154 km). Salisbury's location at the head of Wicomico River was a major factor in growth. At first it was a small colonial outpost set up by Lord Baltimore. In 1732, Salisbury became an official port, growing to be second only to Baltimore as the most active seaport in Maryland. The Gillis-Grier House, Honeysuckle Lodge, Sen. William P. Jackson House, Pemberton Hall, Perry-Cooper House, Poplar Hill Mansion, Union Station, and F. Leonard Wailes Law Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
