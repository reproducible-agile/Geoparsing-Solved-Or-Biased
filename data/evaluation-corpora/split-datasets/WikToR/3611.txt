Huntington is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England. It is part of the Huntington & New Earswick ward and lies on the River Foss, to the north of York and the south of Strensall. Before 1996 it was part of the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire. According to the 2001 census Huntington had a population of 9,277, increasing to 12,108 at the 2011 census. Huntington is made up of mainly low-lying land, with the highest point in the village being only 64 feet above sea level. It covers some 4,800 acres (19 km2) and measures some 4 miles (6 km) from north to south and 3 miles (5 km) east to west. There has been a parish church (All Saints') in this village since 1086. Huntington originally included three villages within the parish boundaries: Towthorpe, Earswick and Huntington. Huntington itself also comprised the small township of West Huntington, including West Huntington Hall. The village is somewhat unusual in that the main settlement and church are separated by a river, the Foss. During the Middle Ages, the part of Huntington to the east of the Foss was part of the Forest of Galtres, a hunting royal forest that covered large areas of land to the north-east of York and is still referred to in many local place names. The Act of Dis-Afforestation of 1629 put an end to this.
