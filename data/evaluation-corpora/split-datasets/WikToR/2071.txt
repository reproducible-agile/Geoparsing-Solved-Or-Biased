Lexington is a village in Richland County in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of the Mansfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,822 at the 2010 census, an increase from 4,165 in 2000. The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course is located just outside Lexington in Troy Township. This venue hosted an annual round of the CART series from 1990 to 2003, has hosted the IndyCar Series since 2007, has hosted the NASCAR Nationwide Series since 2013, hosts Honda Super Bikes, and Vintage Bikes in addition to a few other annual high profile events. Lexington was founded by Amariah Watson, Jr. in 1812, a land speculator who had purchased wide lands locally in order to sell to other settlers. During the 1800s, Lexington had many taverns, hotels, and grist mills â€” most of which at one time or another burned to the ground. In the 19th century, leading members of the community were William Cockley Thad and Martin Kell, Les Griebling, Erwin Castor, Sgt. Patrick Gass, and Jacob Cook. The first road constructed through town was what is now State Route 97, and the second was what is now Lexington-Ontario Road.
