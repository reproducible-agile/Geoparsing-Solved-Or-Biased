Moba is a town located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Tanganyika District of Katanga Province. It is the administrative center of Moba Territory. Moba is situated on the western shore of the southern part of Lake Tanganyika, 140 kilometres (87 mi) south-east of Kalemie, to which it is linked by regular boat services. The Rafiki is the largest and most comfortable of the available ferry services. The larger town of Kirungu (Kilungu) is on a plateau 400 metres (1,300 ft) above the lake and 5 km from Moba. A dirt road leads down from Kirungu to a jetty in Moba. Moba lies just south of the Mulobozi river. The Marungu highlands, a range of steep rugged hills, rises behind the town, bisected by the Mulobozi. The smaller northern section rises to an elevation of about 2,100 metres (6,900 ft) and the larger southern section to about 2,460 metres (8,070 ft). The highest mountain in Moba is called Murumbi. In 1984 Moba had a population of 25,463. Its tribe is mostly Tabwa.
