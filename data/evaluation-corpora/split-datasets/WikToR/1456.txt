Rochester is a small city on the outskirts of Metro Detroit, in northeast Oakland County, in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 12,711 at the 2010 census. The city has the following neighborhoods: Stony Creek is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with Rochester Hills. The Bluffs is a neighborhood on the southeast corner of the city on the border with Rochester Hills. Yates is shared with Shelby Charter Township, Macomb County and Rochester Hills. The first settlers in what would become Rochester, the Graham family, built a log cabin in 1817. The cabin was located where the Quik Pik and Penn Station stores today exist at the intersection of Main and Second Street. The city was named for Rochester, New York, just like Rochester, Minnesota, as many early settlers to the area were formerly from the state of New York. The city became an industrial center with abundant water power from the Clinton River and Paint Creek. The interconnected waterways are no longer used for travel or local industry, but provide natural beauty, some fishing, and a healthy portion of the Clinton Watershed. Historically, past industries formerly located in Rochester included a refinery for sugar beets, a paper products company, and the Western Knitting Mills factory, which was later adapted and utilized during World War II for incendiary productionâ€”businesses that no longer exist in the area. Rochester was served by two railroads as well as the Detroit United Railway, an interurban to Royal Oak and Detroit.
