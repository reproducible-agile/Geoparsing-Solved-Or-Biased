San Fernando is a fourth class municipality in the province of Camarines Sur, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 33,281. San Fernando is administratively subdivided into 22 barangays. Ambos Camarines, the old Camarines Sur, included among its "visitas" or barrios the town of San Fernando. The town, however, also remained as a "barrio" of Milaor for more than 230 years. Pueblo de San Fernando separated from Milaor and was established as an independent pueblo on 1 January 1813. The residents of this old settlement were noted for their religious devotion as manifested by their honor and dedication to San Fernando, the town's patron saint. This patron of San Fernando, according to historical records, was however not the original patron saint for whom the first settlers built the chapel. They actually built a chapel in honor of their patron saint San Fernando. However, for some unusual reasons, the image was lost after it had been transferred into the newly erected chapel. It was said that efforts were wielded to find the missing icon but it all ended into great frustration as the lost image of San Fernando was not found. One resident from the old site where the image was housed later informed the people of San Fernando that the image returned to its original location. With this incident, the Teniente del Barrio then decided to install the image of another saint, Saint John the Baptist. Their celebration of the town and parish fiesta is held every 24 June.
