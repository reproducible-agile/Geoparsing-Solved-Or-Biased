Newcastle is a village in Dixon County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Sioux City, IA–NE–SD Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 325 at the 2010 census. Newcastle was incorporated as a village in 1893, soon after the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway was extended to that point. According to one tradition, it was named from a pioneer settler's house that was known locally as the "new castle". The village may well be named after New Castle, Pennsylvania. Newcastle is located at 42°39′7″N 96°52′31″W (42.652005, -96.875265). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.34 square miles (0.88 km2), all of it land. Located near Newcastle is the Ionia Volcano, a mineral deposit that once sat in cliffs on the edge of the Missouri River. Water from the river would leak through fissures in the cliff and cause steam to rise. Much of the so-called volcano washed into the river in the 1870s, and today the site is more than a mile from the river.
