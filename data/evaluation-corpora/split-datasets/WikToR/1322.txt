Batang Town (Standard Tibetan: འབའ˙ཐང; Chinese: 巴搪 or 八搪; Pinyin: Bātáng), or Xiaqiong Town (Chinese: 夏邛镇; Pinyin: Xiàqióng Zhèn), is a town in Batang County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, in the China on the main route between Chengdu and Lhasa, Tibet, and just east of the Jinsha ('Golden Sands') River, or Upper Yangtse River. It is at an elevation of 2,700 metres (8,900 feet). The name is a transliteration from Tibetan meaning a vast grassland where sheep can be heard everywhere (from ba - the sound made by the sheep + Tibetan tang which means a plain or steppe). According to one source the name in Chinese is 八搪, Pinyin: Bātáng, but, according to The Contemporary Atlas of China (1988), it should be written 巴搪, which also is rendered Bātáng in Pinyin. It is alternatively known as Xiaqiong. 'The plain of Batang, which runs east and west, is some 2 1⁄2 miles [4.0 km] in length, with a breadth of from three-quarters of a mile to a mile [1.2 to 1.6 km]. In the high mountains surrounding it there are three openings—the valley of the Hsiao-pa-chung River to the south-east by which we entered, and two valleys to the north-east and south-west by which the Batang River obtains ingress and egress. Three roads lead along these valleys—to Litang, to the State of Dergé, whose frontier is a couple of days' march distant, and to Tibet and Yunnan respectively."
