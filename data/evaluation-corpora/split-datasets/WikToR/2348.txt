Campbell is a town in the middle of the Mississippi River in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the La Crosse, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4358 as of the 2010 Census. All of the town's population resides in its eastern portion, on the section of French Island denoted French Island CDP by the United States Census Bureau. Some of the island is part of the city of La Crosse. The Town of Campbell borders the city of La Crosse. The unincorporated community of West La Crosse is also located in the town. The town was originally created in 1851, and was officially named after Erasmus D. Campbell, a former Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin. Today, the Town of Campbell is confined to part of a large island bordered by the Mississippi and Black rivers and Lake Onalaska. This island has been traditionally known as "French Island." Joseph French, one of the earliest settlers of the town arrived in May 1851. French's family originated from Leicestershire, England. Later, French-Canadian settlers, primarily farmers from the Canadian Province of Quebec, settled on the island-part of Campbell, then a much larger town between the incorporated settlements of Onalaska and La Crosse.
