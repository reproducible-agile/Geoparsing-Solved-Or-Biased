The history of Novotroitsk goes to the beginning of the 20th century with a small farm in the wilderness. Near it, were the farms Akkermanovsky, Beloshapochny, and the village of Khabarnoye. Several families of peasants/immigrants from Ukraine settled near Silnova and named their settlement Novotroitsk. The 1930s, large industrial buildings were created. Before Novotroitsk was founded, the villagers heard news of the construction of factories in Orsk, and the finding of minerals. Fersman, a well-known academician, spoke in his writings of the fabulous and wealthy Orsk region, and called Orsk-Khalilovsk area a "true gem of the Urals." In the fall of 1929, geologist I. L. Rudnitsky opened the Khalilovsky field hematites. Khalilovsk ore was rare in its composition: it contains chromium, nickel, titanium, and manganese. Industrial tests confirmed its quality. In June 1931, the Government adopted a decision to start construction on the Khalilovsk ores and Karaganda coal, both to be big metallurgical plants. The construction schedule which was set to start building the Khalilovo metallurgical plant was scheduled for 1936. During this period, in the village of Novotroitsk, the first construction builders arrived. In 1935, construction was suspended and only in the spring of 1939 in the Resolution XVIII of Congress it had specifically determined: "... To begin construction of new metallurgical plants (at Khalilovsk Bakalskoye and ores).
