Goshen is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 810 at the 2010 census. Incorporated in 1791, Goshen was first settled in 1768 as a part of Saville (now Sunapee). The name Goshen may have been taken from Goshen, Connecticut, where many residents had relatives. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 22.6 square miles (59 km2), of which 22.5 sq mi (58 km2) is land and 0.1 sq mi (0.26 km2) is water, comprising 0.40% of the town. The long ridge of Mount Sunapee occupies the eastern edge of town. The highest point in Goshen is an unnamed knob on the ridge (near Goves Mountain) where the elevation reaches 2,529 feet (771 m) above sea level. Goshen lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed, though a small corner in the southeast of town is in the Merrimack River watershed. Goshen and the neighboring town of Lempster maintain a combined elementary and middle school, called Goshen-Lempster Cooperative School, located in Lempster. The school serves kindergarten through 8th grade.
