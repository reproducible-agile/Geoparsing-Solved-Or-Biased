Brooklyn is a small unincorporated community in southern Forrest County, Mississippi. It is part of the Hattiesburg, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area. Brooklyn was settled in association with the construction of an early railroad in the area, the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad. The town was originally called Bullis after one of the construction engineers. It was later renamed Brooklyn after one of the pioneer families. Two of the early settlers, John and Sam Perkins, ran the Perkins Merchandise store and Perkins Ferry on Black Creek. At that time, Black Creek was used to raft logs cut from the pine forests surrounding Brooklyn down to the trade center of Pascagoula. Brooklyn is located at latitude 31.0562946, longitude -89.1861676. Brooklyn is served by U.S. Route 49. The City of Brooklyn is served by the Forrest County School District. Also located in Brooklyn are Forrest County Agricultural High School (grades 9-12) and South Forrest Attendance Center (grades 1-8). FCAHS students are known as "Aggies."
