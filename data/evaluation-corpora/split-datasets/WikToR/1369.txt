It is situated at the centre of the state, bordering with Kelantanese territories of Kota Bharu to the north, Pasir Puteh to the east, Tanah Merah to the west and Kuala Krai to the south. It is a home to one of the main campuses of Universiti Teknologi MARA. Its major town and administrative centre is Bandar Machang. The territory of Machang originated as a village of the same name, Kampung Machang. It was opened in 1880 by a group of settlers from Pasir Tumboh, Kota Bharu led by Senik Awang Kecik. On its inception, the territory was mainly economically agrarian with some of the population involved in commerce. Around 1949, Machang was delineated as a minor Territory of Kelantan. Owing to its rapid pace of development and active economic sector, Machang was upgraded as a full Territory on January 1, 1952. The territory is still largely agrarian home to a lot of paddy fields, palm and rubber plantations.
