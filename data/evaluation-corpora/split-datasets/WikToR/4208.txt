Chipata, population 98,416, is the capital of the Eastern Province of Zambia. Having a boma, a market, a hospital, a shopping centre and a number of schools, Chipata is the business and administrative hub that serves the region. The town boasts a four star hotel, a golf course, an airport, a mosque, and even a "welcome arch". The town is the regional head of the Ngoni of Zambia. As such, Ngoni is the primary language, although Nyanja and English are widely spoken, plus some Indian languages, as a large number of Zambian Indians live in the town. Chipata is located near the border with Malawi, and lies on the Great East Road which connects the capitals Lilongwe (130 km) and Lusaka (550 km). The town is a popular access point for the South Luangwa National Park. Chipata comes from the Ngoni word "Chimpata" meaning "large space," in reference to the town situated in a shallow valley between hills. The central neighborhood of Kapata, the original center of town, comes from the Ngoni phrase meaning "small space."
