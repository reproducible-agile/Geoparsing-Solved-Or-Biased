La Trinidad is a first class and capital municipality of the province of Benguet, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 107,188 people. The municipality is known for its strawberry and vegetable plantations earning the town the title "Strawberry Capital of the Philippines". The town currently holds the Guinness World Record for baking the world's largest strawberry shortcake in March 20, 2004. The valley encompassing La Trinidad was originally called "Benguet", a thriving community of Ibaloi migrants from Tinek. Colonial influence reached the area upon Spanish explorers Don M. Quirante's discovery of the valley in 1642, and Lt. Col. Guillermo Galvey's expedition to Benguet in 1829. The valley was later renamed to "La Trinidad" in honor of Galvey's wife. Together with 40 other smaller surrounding rancher√≠as, La Trinidad was placed under the jurisdiction of the newly established Benguet commandancia politico-militar in 1846. La Trinidad was established as the administrative headquarters of the Benguet commandancia during the Spanish Conquest of the Philippines. With the establishment of Benguet as a province under the Republic of the Philippines in 1899, La Trinidad was made as its capital.
