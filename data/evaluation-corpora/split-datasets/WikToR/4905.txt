Caba (Ilocano: Ili ti Caba; Pangasinan: Baley na Caba) is a fourth class municipality in the province of La Union, Philippines. Caba is the birthplace of Diego Silang. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 21,244 people. Caba was a part of the municipality of Aringay until the late-19th century when it was permanently separated to form its own entity. It has a land area of 4,631 hectares (11,440 acres). Caba is between Aringay to the south and Bauang, La Union, a main connection in the Manila-Laoag City itinerary and 248 kilometres (154 mi) from Metro Manila or approximately 5 hours by land transportation. History records show that this municipality used three names interchangeably: Caba, Cava and Caua. According to a local historian Pedro Manongdo, two tales have persisted on how the town got his name. One group referred to an incident when a Spaniard asked an inhabitant the name of the place. The youth mistook the question as an inquiry to the name of the animal he was herding and answered “Cava.” The repetition of the name ended with Cava and later Caba.
