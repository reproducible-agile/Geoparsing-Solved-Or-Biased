Weston is a village and civil parish in the North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England. It is located around 4 miles north of Stevenage, 2.5 miles south of Baldock and the same distance south-east of Letchworth, although it lies in the Hitchin post town. The A1(M) motorway passes to the west and the A505 Baldock bypass to the north, in a cut-and-cover tunnel that passes through the Weston Hills. These hills were made famous by the Robin Hood-style character Jack o'Legs, who was allegedly buried in the village's church graveyard. The legend of Jack o'Legs is connected to the village of Weston, and explained on a signpost in the village green. The legend is that a Jack o'Legs was an abnormally tall man who stole from shops in the nearby town of Baldock. He took his lootings and hid them in a cave somewhere around Weston Hills. After he was captured and severely wounded by the shopkeepers of Baldock he shot an arrow from there 3 miles into the churchyard at Weston to show where he wished to be buried. In the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Weston, there is a grave for Jack o'Legs, which is unusually long, possibly placed there to fuel belief in the legend.
