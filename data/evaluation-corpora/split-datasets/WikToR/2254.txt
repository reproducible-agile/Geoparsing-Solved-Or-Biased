Cervantes is a fourth class municipality in the province of Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 16,573 people. The municipality is officially the Summer Capital of Ilocos Sur. It has a relatively cooler climate than most of lowland Ilocos Sur due to its geographical location and proximity to Mountain Province and Benguet. The municipality is home to the Bessang Pass Natural Monument. Municipality of Cervantes lies along the Southeastern tip of the province. It is bounded by the Municipalities of Mankayan and Bakun (Benguet) on the South; by Alilem (Ilocos Sur) on the Southeast, by Suyo and Sigay (Ilocos Sur) on the West; by Gregorio del Pilar (Concepcion) on the Northwest and Quirino (Angaki) on the North; and by Tadian (Mt. Province) on the East. It is cut Southwesterly by the biggest and longest river in the area, the Abra River. It is almost isolated from the rest of Ilocos Region due to its location and natural barriers. It could be reached from Metro Manila in two (2) ways. One way is by a 3-4 hour mini-bus ride through Cervantes-Tagudin Road, after a 5-6 hour bus ride from Metro Manila, via the City of San Fernando (La Union). The other is by the lengthy but reasonably wide Cervantes- Baguio Road, which could take about 4–5 hours of bus ride from the beautiful City of Baguio, after some 6–7 hours of bus ride from Manila.
