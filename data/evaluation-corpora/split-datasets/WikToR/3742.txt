Kingswood is a suburb in South Dublin, Ireland. It is close to the county town of Tallaght. In the middle of Kingswood there is a square of buildings, which is not to be confused with The Square, which is near Tallaght Town Centre. These are: A quality launderette, an excellent betting shop, a superior fast-food takeaway and Gios Chipper, a majestic salon, an apothacary, a Centra convenience store, a public house with a clock-tower and closeby one community centre. The old community centre now serves as a centre of excellence for hip hop dance, famous speech and drama classes and a Bruce Lee inspired karate dojo ran by one of the worlds few Karate GrandMasters of Kenpo Karate. Next to it, there is the Newer Community Centre. It hosts WeWontPay protests, sport matches (including indoor javelin and Irish Wrestling (IMW)) exercise and health fitness club. It once featured a weekly, now defunct, disco called Chilin' it at Killians .The Scout den which won the Irish Architectural Innovation Award in 1989 is found beside the community centre and houses the 158th Castleview Scout Group. The Roman Catholic parish church is shared with Kilnamanagh, but Kingwood holds 70% of the shares, so that's grand.
