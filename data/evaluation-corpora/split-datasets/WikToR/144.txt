Buena Vista is a residential neighbourhood located near the centre of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It is an older suburban subdivision, including mostly low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2011, the area is home to 3,271 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $67,170, an average dwelling value of $251,560 and a home ownership rate of 77.7%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $304,939. The Buena Vista neighbourhood was within the city limits at the time of Saskatoon's incorporation in 1906. The subdivision west of Lorne Avenue was marketed by three Saskatoon real estate men: W.H. Coy, A. MacDougall and F.E. Guppy. All three eventually had streets named after them; Coy Avenue is still in existence. In 1910 house lots in the area were being advertised for $275. Buena Vista Park, developed in 1911-1912, was designed by U. Morell, a noted landscape architect from Minneapolis. According to a 1913 map of registered subdivisions, the riverbank portion of the current neighbourhood was originally named the Monroe Addition. The majority of residential construction was done before 1946, with a smaller amount up to 1960. After a few decades of very little construction, infill housing projects jumped starting after 1996.
