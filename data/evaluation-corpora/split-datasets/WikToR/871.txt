Dublin is a city located in southwestern Erath County in Central Texas. The population was 3,654 at the time of the 2010 census. The town is the former home of the world's oldest Dr Pepper bottling plant (see Dublin Dr Pepper). The plant was for many years the only U.S. source for Dr Pepper made with real cane sugar (from Texas-based Imperial Sugar), instead of less expensive high fructose corn syrup. Contractual requirements limit the plant's distribution range to a 40-mile radius of Dublin, an area encompassing Stephenville, Tolar, Comanche and Hico. Dublin was the southern terminus of the Wichita Falls and Southern Railroad, one of the properties of Frank Kell, Joseph A. Kemp, and later Orville Bullington of Wichita Falls. The line was abandoned in 1954. Dublin was the boyhood home of legendary golfer Ben Hogan, who was born on August 13, 1912, at the hospital in nearby Stephenville. Hogan lived in Dublin until 1921, when he and his family relocated to Fort Worth. American jurist and 1924 Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee George C. Butte married and resided in Dublin for several years and is interred there at Live Oak Cemetery.
