Quincy is located 20 miles (32 km) west of Tallahassee, Fla., via Highway 90 West, Quincy lies in the rolling hills of North Florida. Part of the woodlands run along the banks of the Ochlockonee River, Little River, and the greater Gadsden County, Fla. area borders reaches the shores of Lake Seminole and Lake Talquin State Park. Quincy was once heavily dependent upon agriculture, farming tomatoes, tobacco, mushrooms, soybeans and other crops for its employment base. In 1828, Governor William P. Duval introduced Cuban tobacco to the territory of Florida. As a result, the culture of shade-grown cigar wrapper tobacco was a dominant factor in the social and economic development of Gadsden County, Florida. Tobacco is a native plant of the western hemisphere. Early European explorers discovered Native Americans growing the plant when they set foot on their soil.
