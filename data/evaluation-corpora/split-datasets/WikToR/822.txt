Cambridge is a city in Dorchester County, Maryland, United States. The population was 12,326 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Dorchester County and the county's largest municipality. Cambridge is the fourth most populous city in Maryland's Eastern Shore region, after Salisbury, Elkton and Easton. Settled by English colonists in 1684, Cambridge is one of the oldest colonial cities in Maryland. At the time of English colonization, the Algonquian-speaking Choptank Indians were already living along the river of the same name. During the colonial years, the English colonists developed farming on the Eastern Shore. The largest plantations were devoted first to tobacco, and then mixed farming. Planters bought enslaved Africans to farm tobacco and mixed farming. The town was a trading center for the area. The town peer was the center for slave trading for the region, a sad history documented well in historical markers throughout the town center. It was incorporated officially in 1793, and occupies part of the former Choptank Indian Reservation. Cambridge was named after the town and county in England. The town became a stop on the underground railroad, which had an extensive network of safe houses for slaves escaping to the north.
