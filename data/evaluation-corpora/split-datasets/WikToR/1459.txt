Rochester is a borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, it is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 3,657 at the 2010 census. Like many places in and around Pittsburgh and especially Beaver County, Rochester has been used for scenes in movies. Scenes in the 1986 movie Gung Ho (starring Pittsburgh native Michael Keaton), the 1996 movie Kingpin (starring Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Bill Murray), and the 2000 movie "Wonder Boys" (starring Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey Jr.) were shot in Rochester. What would eventually become Rochester was originally a Lenape village called Sawcunk before being settled in 1799 in what was then the American frontier by white settlers. During this time, what would eventually became Rochester was known as East Bridgewater, Fairport, and Beaver Point. The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.
