Langar is a small village about four miles south of Bingham in Nottinghamshire and the Vale of Belvoir. To the south of the parish of Langar cum Barnstone, on Langar Airfield, it borders Clawson, Hose and Harby, the district of Melton and Leicestershire. At Hose Lane it meets Colston Bassett. It passes northwards, crossing Harby Lane, where it follows a tributary of the River Smite. At Langar Lane Bridge, it briefly meets Cropwell Bishop, for around 300 metres, then borders the parish of Wiverton Hall, following the start of the River Smite, and briefly following Bingham Road at Wiverton Smite Bridge. It passes on the western edge of Northfield Farm, then the east side of Smite Hill Farm (outside the parish). Near the point where the former railway crossed the River Smite, it meets Whatton-in-the-Vale. It meets Granby at Granby Lane, which it follows and the River Whipling, east of Barnstone (part of the parish). The boundary follows southwards, to the east of the former Bingham to Melton railway, and south of Granby Gap woods (outside the parish) it meets Leicestershire.
