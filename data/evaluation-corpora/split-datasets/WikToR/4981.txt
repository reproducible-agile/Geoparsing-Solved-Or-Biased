Elderslie is a suburb of the Macarthur Region of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia in Camden Council. In addition, it is located on the east side of the Nepean River. It has a small local shop, high school, primary school, netball courts, cricket, AFL, Football (Rugby League) oval, a BMX track and a historic house John Oxley Cottage built in the 1890s and converted into the Camden Visitors' centre in 1989. It was named after explorer John Oxley who held an early grant of land in the area. The area now known as Elderslie was probably originally home to the Tharawal people, based in the Illawarra region, although the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people were also known to have inhabited the greater Camden area. Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers.
