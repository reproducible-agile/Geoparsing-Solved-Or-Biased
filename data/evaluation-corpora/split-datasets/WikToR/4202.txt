Alcala (Pangasinan: Baley na Alcala; Ilocano: Ili ti Alcala), is a third class municipality in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 41,077 people with land area of 5,508 hectares. Alcala recently broke the world record for longest grill measuring about 3 kilometres (9,840 ft). What is known now as Alcala was formerly a barrio of Bayambang, formerly called "Dangla", a vernacular term referring to a medicinal shrub which grows abundantly in the place. As a barrio, it was subdivided into several smaller units called sitios, namely: Bugyao, Bacud, Cupi, Bitulao, Guinawedan, Anulid, Cabicalan, Pindangan, Camanggaan and Sinabaan On April 1, 1873, the settlers established a community. They submitted a petition calling for the cessation of Dangla into a separate township, but it took more than two years for the Spanish Authorities to take notice of the settlers' demands. Finally, on September 20, 1875, a Royal Decree No. 682 was issued making the place an official municipality to be named Alcala, the name of a town in Spain where the then Governor of Pangasinan hailed from.
