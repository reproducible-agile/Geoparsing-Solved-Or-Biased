Hanover is a town in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 13,879 at the 2010 census. The area of Hanover was first settled by English settlers in 1649 when William Barstow, a farmer, built a bridge along the North River at what is now Washington Street. The land was the westernmost portion of the town of Scituate, and it would officially separate and be incorporated as a town June 14, 1727. The name "Hanover" is probably a tribute to King George I, the first Hanoverian King of Great Britain. (While George I died on June 11, 1727, the reports would not have reached the colonies until after the town's incorporation.) Hanover's early industry revolved around farming, small mills and a shipbuilding area along the North River. Later industries would include tack factories and shoe factories along the smaller waterways in the town. The town was the site of the invention of the first tack-making machine, and making tacks and fireworks were among the industries of the later 19th century for Hanover. Today, Hanover is mostly residential. The Hanover Mall and other shops are located near the intersection of Routes 3 and 53. In 2008 Hanover American Legion Post 149 baseball team won the state title. In the Summer of 2012 - Hanover became home to the New England Football League (NEFL)'s newest expansion, Semi-Professional Football Team - The South Shore Chiefs. Home games are played at Hanover High School.
