Springfield is a ward in south east Birmingham, England, created in 2004 from much of the old Sparkhill ward. It is a part of the formal district of Hall Green. The area is served by the Sparkhill Library that has, with its distinctive clock tower, developed into a local landmark. It was built in 1900 as the council house for the Yardley District Council. The building was converted into a library and opened on January 19, 1923. It is one of the earliest examples of double glazing windows in a public building. St John's Church, Sparkhill is the Anglican Parish church for the northern part of Springfield Ward. It is also home of the charity, Narthex Sparkhill. Also in the area is St Christopher's Church, Springfield. It is represented on Birmingham City Council by one Labour and two Liberal Democrat councillors; Tanveer Choudhry (Liberal Democrats), Jerry Evans (Liberal Democrats) and Mohammed Fazal (Labour). Springfield has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Pete Cotton. Birmingham City Council: Springfield Ward
