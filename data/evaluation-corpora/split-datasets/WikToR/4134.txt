Masaka is a town in Central Uganda, lying west of Lake Victoria. It is the chief town of Masaka District. Besides being the headquarters of Masaka District, the town is the regional headquarters and largest metropolitan area in the districts of Lyantonde, Sembabule, Lwengo, Bukomansimbi, Kalungu, Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala. Masaka lies approximately 140 kilometres (87 mi) to the southwest of Kampala, on the highway to Mbarara. The town lies very close to the Equator, as can be seen from the latitude values. It was Uganda's second-biggest town for a long time. Today this status has changed, as the city was largely destroyed in the Uganda-Tanzania War of 1979 and again in the 1981-1986 civil war that removed Obote from power for the last time. The coordinates of the town are:0°20'28.0"S, 31°44'10.0"E (Latitude:-0.341111; Longitude:31.736111). According to the 2002 national census, the population of Masaka was about 67,800. In 2010, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), estimated the population of the town at 73,300. In 2011, UBOS estimated the mid-year population of Masaka at 74,100. In August 2014, the national population census put Masaka's population at 103,829.
