Quincy (formerly, Quinsy) is a census-designated place and the county seat of Plumas County, California. The population was 1,728 during the 2010 census, down from 1,879 during the 2000 United States Census. Quincy started as a Gold Rush community just outside Elizabethtown, CA. Elizabethtown started in 1852 and slowly dissolved and moved a mile away into American Valley to form Quincy after 1858. Quincy is named after the city of Quincy, Illinois, named in turn after John Quincy Adams (1767 - 1848), the sixth president of the United States (1825 - 1829). The Quincy post office opened in 1855. James H. Bradley, one of the organizers of Plumas County, donated the land at Quincy for establishment of the county seat. He then laid out the town and named it after his ranch in Illinois. Quincy is located at 39°56′11″N 120°56′53″W (39.936279, -120.947921). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.2 square miles (11 km2), all of it is land. Quincy is underlain by metasedimentary rock of the Shoo Fly Complex. Its dominant silica-rich clastic material weathers to a stony coarse soil which includes the well or somewhat excessively drained alluvial fan material (mainly Forgay very gravelly sandy loam) on which most of Quincy's businesses and homes have been built. Cultivated land north of the residential area lies on poorly drained loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.
