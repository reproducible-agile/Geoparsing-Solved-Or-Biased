Hot Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in Bath County, Virginia, United States. The population as of the 2010 Census was 738. It is located about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Warm Springs on U.S. Route 220. Hot Springs is the site of a number of resorts that make use of the springs. The area is historically important to the development of Bath County. As early as the mid 18th century, travelers came to use the springs. The first inn to accommodate them was built in 1766 by Thomas Bullitt. The most prominent modern resort, The Homestead, traces its origin to this inn. The Homestead, Mustoe House, The Yard, Barton Lodge, Switchback School, and Garth Newel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On March 21, 2009, two employees of the The Homestead were shot and killed in the hotel kitchen; the community of Hot Springs was briefly locked down under code red procedures as a security precaution. Authorities identified fellow employee Beacher Ferrel Hackney as a suspect in the killings. The slayings were the first homicides in Bath County since 1983. Beacher Hackney was a fugitive until his remains were later found in a wooded area near the Cascades Golf Course. The Virginia State Police crime lab confirmed that it was indeed Hackney's remains, closing the case.
