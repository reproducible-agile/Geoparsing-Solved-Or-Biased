Read in 1876. He farmed the land for 23 years until the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway arrived in 1899. Thomas H. Brown, Burlington's right-of-way man, purchased 271⁄2 acres of land from Read for the purpose of establishing a townsite. He also purchased 20 more acres from Worthington banker and real estate dealer George Dayton. Dayton later went on to found the Dayton's Department Store chain. In the fall of 1899, A. J. Keller arrived on the first train and took up his duties as station agent. Early in 1900, H. H. Douglas and the Rothchild Grain Company both built grain elevators in Reading after flipping a coin to determine location. Coal and lumber yards were quickly established by James S Ramage. By the time the town was surveyed and platted in the summer of 1900, a general store, a hardware store, a blacksmith shop, and a restaurant had been added to Reading's list of businesses. The Summit Lake Presbyterian Church was moved into town from the country, and a small school house was also moved into town to educate the youth of Reading. The Reading State Bank was established in 1902. The Farmer's Mutual Telephone Company was established in 1905 with lines connecting to Rushmore, Wilmont, and Fulda.
