Bangor is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Bangor is located 28 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire in the area commonly called Menai. Bangor sits south of the Georges River and to the west of the Woronora River. The name 'Bangor' was selected in 1895 by the land's owner, a farmer named Owen Jones, after his birthplace Bangor in Wales. To avoid confusion with Bangor in Tasmania, the Postmaster General's Office changed the suburb name to Menai in 1910. Another Australian Bangor is located in South Australia. Menai Bridge is a town opposite the original Bangor, on the Menai Strait in Wales. When Menai expanded, the eastern section was renamed Bangor in 1976. As part of the modern development of Bangor, the streets were all named with an Aboriginal theme. Bangor is a mostly residential suburb with a small shopping centre which consists of Bangor Community Pharmacy, Bangor Post Office, Bangor Bakery, The Chicken Spot, IGA, Peter's Bangor Chinese, Thai Max, ABC School Wear, Bangor Dry Cleaners, Bangor Butchers and Doug Frost Swim School.
