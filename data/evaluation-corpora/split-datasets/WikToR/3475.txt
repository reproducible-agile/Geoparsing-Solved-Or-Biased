Hudson is a city located along the west border of Columbia County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,713. The city is named after the adjacent Hudson River and ultimately after the explorer Henry Hudson. Hudson is the county seat of Columbia County. Hudson is sister city with Pallisa, Uganda. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.3 square miles (6.0 km2). 2.2 square miles (5.6 km2) of it is land and 0.15 square miles (0.4 km2), or 7.38%, is water. Hudson is located on what began as a spit of land jutting into the Hudson River between the South Bay and North Bay, now both largely filled in. Across the Hudson River lies the town of Athens in Greene County, New York; a ferry connected the two municipalities during much of the 19th century. Between them lies Middle Ground Flats, a former sandbar that grew due to both natural silting and also from dumping the spoils of dredging; today it is inhabited by deer and a few occupants of quasi-legal summer shanties. The town of Greenport borders the other three sides of the city.
