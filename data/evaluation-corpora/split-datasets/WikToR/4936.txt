Sund is a municipality in Hordaland county, Norway. The municipality is located in the traditional district of Midhordland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Skogsvåg. Other larger villages in Sund include Klokkarvik, Tælavåg, Kausland, and Hammarsland. Sund covers the southern third of the island of Store Sotra, west of the city of Bergen. It also includes many smaller, surrounding islands. The history of the municipality dates back to 1838, when Sund was first established as a formannskapsdistrikt, the precursor of the modern municipalities. Sund is a predominantly rural municipality, with no major settlements, the largest being Hammarsland with approximately 900 inhabitants (in 2013). Due to the proximity to the city of Bergen, a large proportion of the population commutes to the city to work. The parish of Sund was established as a formannskapsdistrikt (municipality) on 1 January 1838. On 1 January 1886, the southern island district of Sund (population: 2,396) was separated to form the new municipality of Austevoll. The municipal borders have not changed since that time.
