The population was 588 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area. Nome is located at 30°2′9″N 94°24′46″W (30.035878, -94.412661). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), all of it land. Initially called Congreve Station, this location was a stop on the Texas and New Orleans Railroad in the early 1860s. The name for the town came from the influx of people due to the discovery of oil in the early 1900s (similar to the gold strikes at Nome, Alaska), hence the name became Nome in 1903. Although rice farming would still be the foremost activity of the town, the discovery of natural gas and oil would create a new industry for the region in 1936. Many years later, Nome would become incorporated in 1971.
