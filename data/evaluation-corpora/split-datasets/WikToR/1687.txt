Aguada (/əˈɡwɑːdə/; Spanish: [aˈɣwaða]) is a municipality of Puerto Rico, located in the western coastal valley region bordering the Atlantic Ocean, east of Rincón, west of Aguadilla and Moca; and north of Anasco and Mayaguez. It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area. Aguada's population is spread over 17 wards and Aguada Pueblo, which is the downtown area and the administrative center of the city. According to sources, a Taíno settlement called Aymamón was located close to the Culebrinas River. Although there is dispute to it, some sources believe that Christopher Columbus entered the island of Puerto Rico through Aguada on his second voyage in November 1493. The nearby city of Aguadilla also claims to be the site of Columbus' arrival. While there is no specific historical proof, it is known that many of the first attempts to set up a town on the island were in Aguada. In July 1510, Cristóbal de Sotomayor received control of the area from Juan Ponce de León and renamed the town Villa de Sotomayor.  However, in 1511 the settlement was attacked and burned by the local Taínos. That same year, the King ordered a monastery established in the island, and the Ermita de Espinar was founded. The name of the region was then changed to San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada, since the friars were Franciscan. The monastery was finished in 1516. In 1526, King Charles I of Spain officially founded the Aguada settlement. However, in 1529, Taínos attacked the monastery killing the friars and burning the settlement.
