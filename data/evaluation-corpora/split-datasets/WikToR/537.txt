Homes with no foundations, no floors, no windows, doors, or walls were scattered throughout" the community. Grinberg added that "strong winds stirred up suffocating clouds of dust in the streets" because all of the streets were unpaved. She added that "[s]mall gullies formed when it rained because there was no drainage system.
