The Claremont district is a neighborhood straddling the city limits of Oakland and Berkeley in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California, United States. It lies at an elevation of 266 feet (81 m). The main thoroughfares are Claremont and Ashby Avenues. The name was given in the late 19th century by a real estate developer. Previously, the area was grazing land owned by a man named Harwood. Harwood's name was given to the canyon and the creek draining the canyon, previously shown on maps as the north fork of Temescal Creek. When a telegraph line was strung through this canyon, it was dubbed "Telegraph Canyon". A stage coach line ran up the canyon and over the summit into Contra Costa County. This became an early auto route over the Berkeley Hills until the first auto tunnel opened up in the 1910s at the top of Old Tunnel Road to the south of Claremont Canyon, above where the Caldecott Tunnel is today. Today, Harwood's/Telegraph Canyon is Claremont Canyon, and North Fork Temescal/Harwood's Creek is Claremont Creek.
