Salem was settled in the summer of 1790 — as "New Salem" — by forty Seventh Day Baptist families from Shrewsbury, New Jersey. It was formally chartered by the Virginia Assembly in 1794. Notable settler family names included Lippincott, Maxson, Babcock, Plumer, Davis, and Randolph. By the 1870s, the town was more frequently being called "Salem" than "New Salem", as the separation of West Virginia from Virginia in 1863 had diminished the need to distinguish it from the town named Salem near Roanoke. The US Postal Service made the change official in 1884.
