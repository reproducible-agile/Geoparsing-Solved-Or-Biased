San Juan (formerly Lapog) is a third class municipality in the province of Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 25,199 people. Because it produces most of the goods made of buri leaf in the province, it is sometimes called the Buri Capital of Ilocos Sur. The town of Lapog was established in 1772. The name of the municipality has gone through a series of changes. The early settlers and occupants called it "Lapo", short for "Lapo-Lapo", a tall grass which grew everywhere in the area. In the year 1772, Don Tomas Aquino, the first local leader, initiated the organization of the scattered communities into one, calling the place "Lapog", a derivative of local vernacular "Lap-Lapog" which means unirrigated land. For 189 years, "Lapog" remained in the records as the official name of the town until June 18, 1961, Republic Act No. 3386 was enacted and it was renamed to San Juan. Since most of the inhabitants were of the belief that religious names bring peace, happiness, and prosperity, the town was renamed "San Juan", after the name of its patron saint, Saint John the Baptist.
