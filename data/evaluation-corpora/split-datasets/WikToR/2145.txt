Nono is one of the woredas in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. It is named after the Nono Oromo, a subgroup of the Macha Oromo, who live in this area. Part of the West Shewa Zone, Nono is bordered on the southwest by the Gibe River which separates it from the Jimma Zone, on the northwest by Dano, on the north by Cheliya, on the northeast by Tikur, on the east by the Southwest Shewa Zone, and on the southeast by the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region. Jibat woreda was part of Nono woreda. Nono was selected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in 2003 as an area for voluntary resettlement for farmers from overpopulated areas. That year this woreda became the home for a total of 590 heads of households and 391 total family members. The settlers included 861 individuals (693 family head and 168 family members) who came from Dodotana Sire, Hitosa, Merti, and Ziway Dugda woredas in the Arsi Zone. The next year this woreda was selected again as a resettlement area, and became the home of a total of 2370 heads of household and a total of 16,350 family members.
