Phalia (Urdu تحصیل پھالیہ ) is a Tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin District, Punjab, Pakistan. The population of Phalia was calculated to be 25,914 in 2007 (21,025 in 1998). Alexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum in July 326 BC at the Battle of the Hydaspes River where he defeated the Indian king Porus. According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes, which he named Bukephala or Bucephala to honour his famous and loyal horse Bukephalus or Bucephalus. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum City but that is wrong. Phalia was named after Bucephalus on the name of the Alexander's dead horse and presently a tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin District. The Alexander while forwarding from Taxila opted alternate way despite of using traditional route i.e. today's GT road and built two cities on opposite banks of the river Hydaspes en route between Bhera and Mong. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. Jalalpur Sharif is located on west of the river Jhelum whereas Phalia on eastern bank in Mandi Bahauddin District close to river Jhelum earlier known as Hydaspes.
