Bor (Serbian Cyrillic: Бор) is a town and municipality located in eastern Serbia, with one of the largest copper mines in Europe - RTB Bor. It has been a mining center since 1904, when a French company began operations there. It is the administrative center of the Bor District of Serbia. The population of the town is 34,160, while municipality has 48,615. The name is derived from the Serbian word Bor (Бор), meaning "pine". Bor is surrounded by many beautiful places such as Banjsko Polje, the spa-town Brestovačka Banja, the lake Borsko Jezero, and the mountain Stol, and it is very close to the mountain Crni Vrh. Neolithic Bubanj-Salkuca culture ceramics and anthropomorphic-zoomorphic figurines were found in Krivelj. In 1903 the mine of Bor was opened which was important moment for the development of Bor. The poet Miklós Radnóti wrote here some of the most beautiful poems ever written in Hungarian during his forced labour (1944) in the copper mines. In 1947 Bor officially had a town status - at the time its population was 11,000.
