Houston is a city in and one of two county seats of Chickasaw County, in northern Mississippi. The population was 3,623 at the 2010 census. Judge Joel Pinson donated land for development of a town on the condition that it would be named for Sam Houston, a childhood friend. In 1909, Houston became home to the first Carnegie library in the state after L.B. Reid, then-superintendent of schools, wrote to Andrew Carnegie, an industrialist and philanthropist who created a matching program for libraries, telling of the need for a public library. Houston hosts the Mississippi Flywheel Festival in April and September of every year. Houston is located west of the center of Chickasaw County at 33°53′53″N 89°0′6″W (33.898090, -89.001646).
