Burton is a small village in the community of Rossett in the county borough of Wrexham, Wales. The hamlet of Burton Green is a separate settlement and is located a few miles from Burton. The village is predominantly rural in nature and comprises a mixture of working farms and prestige residential properties. There are no shops in Burton though the village is 2 miles from the village of Rossett, where there is a variety of shops, a post office, bank, chemist, off-licence, and plenty of pubs and restaurants. There is also a local farm shop in Burton, for fresh meat, poultry, eggs and other locally-grown produce. Firmly Welsh despite the proximity to the border with England, 7.7% of Burton residents are Welsh speakers. It is an ancient village that, before the coming of the North Wales Mineral Railway, was more important than Rossett itself. The village dates back to Saxon times and was settled by Angles from the Kingdom of Mercia. Today the village is little more than a backwater on the old road between Rossett and Caergwrle.
