Lipa (Tagalog pronunciation: [liˈpaʔ]), officially the City of Lipa (Filipino: Lungsod ng Lipa), is a first class component city in the province of Batangas in the Philippines. It is one of the three cities in Batangas (the others are Batangas City and Tanauan). It is located 78 kilometres (48 mi) south of Manila and has a population of 283,468 people according to the 2010 census. The city is named after a species of tree in the Urticaceae family, lipa (Dendrocnide meyeniana), known for the stinging trichomes on its twigs. Lipa City is a recreational, religious, commercial, industrial and educational center. The city is also home to the Fernando Air Base, former headquarters of the Philippine Air Force's 100th Training Wing and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), known in military circles as the Baguio of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) provide access to Batangas City and Metro Manila. Batangueños from the early years had their settlement in Bombon Lake and began dispersing to other places when the volcano erupted. While a group of people was moving to another settlement area, the image of St. Sebastian was stolen from them and later on was found on a tree called “lipa”. People believed that the patron saint wished to name that place “Lipa”.
