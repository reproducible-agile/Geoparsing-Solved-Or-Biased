Halifax is a town in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 7,518 at the 2010 census. Halifax was first settled by Europeans, most notably the Bosworth family from Bosworth Fields in England, in 1669, growing with lumbering and agriculture. It was officially separated from the town of Plympton and incorporated in 1734, and was named for Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. The town was part of an early effort to create a canal between Buzzards Bay and Massachusetts Bay, when in 1795 a canal was proposed between the Taunton River and North River. However, the plan never succeeded, although the town's sawmills continued to grow, as did cranberry production, iron furnaces and a wool mill. The railroad came in the nineteenth century, providing access for people from the city to the shores of Silver Lake and the Monponsett Ponds. Today the town is mostly residential, with a small retail area growing at the center of town. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 17.3 square miles (45 km2), of which 16.1 square miles (42 km2) is land and 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), or 6.81%, is water. Statistically, Halifax is the 235th largest town in the Commonwealth by land area, and is eighteenth out of the twenty-seven communities in Plymouth County. Halifax is bordered by Hanson to the north, Pembroke to the northeast, Plympton to the southeast, Middleborough to the southwest, and Bridgewater and East Bridgewater to the west. Halifax is approximately 12 miles (19 km) west of Plymouth, 13 miles (21 km) southeast of Brockton, and 33 miles (53 km) south-southeast of Boston.
