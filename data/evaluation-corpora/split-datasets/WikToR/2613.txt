Collinsville is a city in Rogers and Tulsa counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, and a part of the Tulsa, Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named for Dr. A. H. Collins, an engineer and surveyor who first surveyed the land that became this community. The population was 5,606 according to the 2010 census, an increase of 37.5 percent from 4,077 at the 2000 census. A community that had existed here had no official name until Dr. A. H. Collins, the town namesake, established a post office on May 28, 1897. Henry P. Cook was the first postmaster. Then it became known as either Collins or Collins Post Office. The name officially became Collinsville by June 1898 and it incorporated as a city in April 1899. The population in 1900 was 376. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe routed its line from Kansas to Owasso, Oklahoma about a mile west of Collinsville in 1899, to avoid crossing an additional stream. The town's buildings were moved on rollers to be nearer the track in 1899 and 1900. Collinsville originally was located in Rogers County. In 1918, the residents voted to be annexed by Tulsa County, in order to be nearer a county seat. It was only 20 miles (32 km) north of Tulsa.
