The history of the town of San Jose dates back to 1601 when this town was a barrio of Lagonoy under the name Danlog. The old Parish Priest of Lagonoy, Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called "Cabayawasan" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. The construction of the church began in 1818. It was a cooperative effort of the people of Lagonoy who worked on the northern part and the people of Danlog on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism. In 1813, the town of San Jose was officially established under the name "Patrocinio" derived from the word "Patron", meaning model. Then it was changed to Patrocinio de San Jose in honor of its Patron Saint, Saint Joseph the Patriarch. Later in 1883, it was shortened to "San Jose" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of San Jose and Don Macario Agustin, the first Captain Municipal of the town.
