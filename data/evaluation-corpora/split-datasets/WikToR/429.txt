La Paz is a fifth class municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 19,133 people. The legend of La Paz, bordering on fiction and history, is an interesting one. It is said that long ago, a fisherman from Samar named Capuyong came to Abuyog to market his catch. There he met and fell in love with Casinas and they were married according to pre-Spanish customs. After marriage, they left Abuyog to look for a place in which to live. Coming to a river that is now called Gibuga, they followed its source until they reached a tributary that was named Cabadyangan River where they decided to stay. They had three children: Garcia, Gabic and Badol. Gabic left for Hindang, while Badol settled in Dagami. Garcia, the eldest, stayed home. He married a certain Agustina of Abuyog with whom he had 18 children. Meanwhile, the Spaniards had settled in Abuyog. They found it difficult to convert Casinal and Capuyong to Christianity. The couple clung obstinately to their religion. Condemned to die for refusing to embrace the new religion, they were tied to a jar full of stones and flung off the coast of Dulag.
