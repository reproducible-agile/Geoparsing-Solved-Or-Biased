Ona is a small unincorporated community along US 60 (the old Midland Trail) in Cabell County, West Virginia. It is situated roughly half-way between the towns of Barboursville to the west and Milton to the east. Ona is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 287,702. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000. Ona is home to four notable places. The first is Cabell Midland High School, which is the consolidated regional secondary school for students living in the eastern half of Cabell County. This is a rather large high school of modern construction, with extensive athletic facilities. The student population varies from 1,500 to 2,000 students. A second landmark is the Ona Racetrack. This is a prime location for local stock-car racing competitions. The track has had its share of financial difficulties and has been closed several times in recent years. The last time NASCAR held a Cup level race on a Tuesday was Aug. 11, 1970, when Richard Petty won the West Virginia 300 in Ona.
