According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.43 square miles (3.70 km2), all of it land. The city is roughly bounded by St. Louis to the east, Webster Groves to the north, Marlborough to the west and Mackenzie and Affton to the south.

The land which became Shrewsbury originally belonged to Gregorie Sarpy and Charles Gratiot; by 1890, it was divided into farms and sold to families. The area now known as Shrewsbury was a 278-acre (1.13 km2) farm owned by General John Murdoch. The Murdoch farm was called Shrewsbury Park, named after a town in England. In 1913, concerned resident Joseph Burge organized the Shrewsbury Improvement Association to improve Shrewsbury and develop its first sewer system. Shrewsbury was incorporated and became a village in 1913; shortly thereafter a sanitation system was established, reducing water-borne diseases prevalent at the time.
