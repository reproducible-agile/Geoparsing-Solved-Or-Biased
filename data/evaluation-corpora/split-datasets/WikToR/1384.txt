Gladstone is a city in Clay County, Missouri, is a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. The City of Gladstone has the advantage of being located only 10 minutes from downtown Kansas City, and 10 minutes from Kansas City International Airport. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 26,365. How did Gladstone get its name? There are two versions of the story, so you’ll have to decide which one you prefer. One version is told in a beautiful, framed calligraphy scroll which was signed and presented to the City on July 4, 1976 by two members of the first City Council who were instrumental in the City’s incorporation in 1952. The story goes that when the Petition for Incorporation was presented to the Circuit Court of Clay County, the bearers were informed the Petition was incomplete because the name of the proposed new city was not shown. As time was of the essence (Kansas City had plans to annex this area), a hurried meeting was called and Mrs. Maria Harless, who later became the first City Clerk, suggested the name of Gladstone. At that time, much publicity was being given to Southwestern Bell Telephone Company’s opening of the new Gladstone telephone exchange in this area. Mrs. Harless reasoned that the publicity this name received would also provide some much-needed publicity for this newborn city. Thus, the name Gladstone was borrowed from the telephone company.
