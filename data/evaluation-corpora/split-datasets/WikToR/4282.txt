For the town in: Butte County; see Bagdad, Butte County, California and the town in Arizona; see Bagdad, Arizona Bagdad is a ghost town in the Mojave Desert, in San Bernardino County, California. Bagdad is located along the historic U.S. Route 66, east of Barstow and Ludlow, and west of Amboy and Needles. The town was founded in 1883 when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway railway line between Barstow and Needles was built. At this time, Bagdad provided services to the Orange Blossom Mine several miles to the north, and to the War Eagle Mine several miles to the south. In addition, a dirt track extended south past the War Eagle Mine into the Dale Mining District in the Pinto Mountains. Bagdad was long a thriving town along the National Old Trails Road and the famous Route 66. It was bypassed by the opening of Interstate 40 to the north in 1973, and lost traveler's business and resident population. The remaining buildings were razed in 1991, leaving little trace of the town. Bagdad holds the record for the longest dry streak in United States history with 767 straight days without rain, from October 3, 1912 to November 8, 1914. It is to the south of the Granite Mountains and the Mojave National Preserve, and north of the Bullion Mountains.
