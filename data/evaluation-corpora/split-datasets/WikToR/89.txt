San Carlos, officially City of San Carlos and often referred to as San Carlos City, is a second class component city in the province of Negros Occidental, Philippines. The town gained city status on July 1, 1960, per Republic Act 2643. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 129,981 people. Located along the coast of Ta√±on Strait, the city is located at the crossroads of four major cities in the Visayas: Cebu City, Bacolod City, Iloilo City and Dumaguete City. It has a 40 km coastline of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by Refugio Island (also known as Sipaway Island). Due to these aspects, the Philippine Ports Authority has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two RO-RO vessels and the extension of the length of the port to 242.5 meters.
