Ivanovo (Russian: Иваново; IPA: [ɪˈvanəvə]) is a city and the administrative center of Ivanovo Oblast, Russia, located 254 kilometers (158 mi) from Moscow and approximately 100 kilometers (62 mi) from Yaroslavl, Vladimir, and Kostroma. Population: 408,330 (2010 Census); 431,721 (2002 Census); 481,042 (1989 Census). The Uvod River, a tributary of the Klyazma, flows from north to south, dividing the city in to two halves. There are also two rivers in Ivanovo: the Talka and the Kharinka. The city is first mentioned in 1561, when it was given to the Cherkassky princely family by Ivan IV, after the latter's marriage to Maria Cherkasskaya. However, the relevant document has since been lost. The modern city was created by merging the old flax-processing village Ivanovo with the industrial Voznesensky Posad in 1871. Yakov Garelin—a patron of arts, historian, manufacturer, and public figure—is considered to be the founder of the city and its first head. Under his government, the city began to develop, industrialise, and grow.
