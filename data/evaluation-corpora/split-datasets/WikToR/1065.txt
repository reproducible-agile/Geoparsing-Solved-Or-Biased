Portland was settled because of the logging trade and what buildings were here in the early 19th century came as a result of this industry. It served to increase at least one business – that of the taverns and hotels. Records show that the Hibblertown Hotel (present Ackerson house on State Street), the Dill’s Tavern (oldest tavern, was located on the south side of Emery’s, now torn down) and the What Cheer Inn (present Duckloe Showroom at the corner of Delaware Avenue and Main Street) all prospered because of loggers.
