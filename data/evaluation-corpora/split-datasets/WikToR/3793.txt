Peterborough /ˈpiːtərbɔːroʊ/ PEE-tər-bur-oh is a city on the Otonabee River in Central Ontario, Canada, 125 kilometres (78 mi) northeast of Toronto. According to the 2011 Census, the population of the City of Peterborough was 78,698. The population of the Peterborough Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), which includes the surrounding Townships of Selwyn, Cavan Monaghan, Otonabee-South Monaghan, and Douro-Dummer, was estimated in 2014 at 123,270. It presently has the 33rd largest CMA in Canada. The current mayor of Peterborough is Daryl Bennett. Peterborough's nickname is "The Electric City" as it was the first town in Canada to use electric streetlights. It also underscores the historical and present-day importance of technology and manufacturing as an economic base of the city, which has operations from large multi-national companies such as Siemens, Rolls Royce, and General Electric, and more local technology businesses such as Fisher Gauge and Bryston. Electricity was one of the reasons Quaker Oats moved to the city, and as part of PepsiCo, remains a major fixture in the downtown area to this day. Peterborough is known as the gateway to the Kawarthas, "cottage country", a large recreational region of the province. It is named in honour of Peter Robinson, an early Canadian politician who oversaw the first major immigration to the area. The city is the seat of Peterborough County.
