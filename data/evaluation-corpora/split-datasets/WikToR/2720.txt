Holt is an unincorporated community within Delhi Charter Township, Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is a census-designated place (CDP) used for statistical purposes. The population was 23,973 at the 2010 census. The community is southeast of Lansing, just south of I-96 between US-127 and M-99. The city of Mason is about 6 miles (9.7 km) southeast and the village of Dimondale is about 6 miles (9.7 km) west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.3 square miles (11 km2), of which 4.3 square miles (11 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.46%) is water. Holt is home to an ancient, glacial esker. This esker, the longest in Michigan at roughly twenty miles, can be traced from south Lansing through Holt to just beyond Mason. The first permanent settlers of Delhi Township, John Norris and Fred Luther, arrived in 1837. In 1850, 402 settlers resided in the township. By 1857, Delhi Center (now present-day Holt) had a post office, hotel, tavern, and several other businesses. The post office at Delhi Center was renamed Holt in 1860 to prevent confusion with Delhi Mills in Washtenaw County. Joseph Holt was the U.S. Postmaster General during that time.
