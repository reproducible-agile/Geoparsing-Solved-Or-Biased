Amherst (/ˈæmhərst/) is a city in Lorain County, Ohio, United States. The population was 12,021 at the 2010 census. The original village which eventually became known as Amherst, was established by pioneer settler Josiah Harris  (who relocated to this area about 1818), although the village began as "Plato" in the 1820s, and later was called "Amherstville", and subsequently "North Amherst", until finally just 'Amherst'. The final name, "Amherst", for the village, was simply named for the Township in which it is located, Amherst Township (which, decades prior to the village's final name, had been named for the Town of Amherst, New Hampshire). The village is often said to have had its beginnings as early as 1811, because land which was settled by pioneer Jacob Shupe, about a mile north of the original village site, was eventually (at a much later time) included into the Amherst city-limits. However, the actual original village plot did not encompass Shupe's site (although Shupe's pioneering efforts within the township, including his building a grist-mill and distillery, certainly added to the area's desirability for later pioneers to settle here). By the latter 1800's, Amherst acquired the title Sandstone Center of the World. Many early buildings are constructed of native sandstone, and the quarries were also an important source of grindstones. There were nine sandstone quarries in the area operating at the peak of production. Cleveland Quarries Company, established in 1868, no longer quarries in Amherst but is still actively quarrying Berea Sandstone.
