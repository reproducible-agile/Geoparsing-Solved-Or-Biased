Gela (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdʒɛːla]; Ancient Greek: Γέλα), is an ancient town (among the oldest continually inhabited in southern Italy) and comune in the province of Caltanissetta in the south of Sicily, Italy. The city is located about 84 kilometres (52 miles) from the city of Caltanissetta, on the Mediterranean Sea. The city has a larger population than the provincial capital, and ranks second in land area. As of 2014 its population was 76,723. The city was founded around 688 BC by colonists from Rhodes and Crete, 45 years after the founding of Syracuse. The city was named after the river Gela. The Greeks had many colonies in the south of what is now Italy, and for many centuries the Greeks had a major influence on the area. Gela flourished and, after only a century, a group of Geloi founded the colony of Agrigento. The expansion, however, led to economic and social strain, which led the plebs to leave the city and settle in nearby Maktorion. However, the revolt was opposed by the high priest of Diana and the exiled plebs returned to Gela.
