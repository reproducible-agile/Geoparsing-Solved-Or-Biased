Local producers shipped pickles to Quincy off a rail platform about a mile west of the present Paloma. Daniel Gooding, an early settler, offered to build the railroad a depot and platform if it would move the Pickleville platform to the town he platted on his land. The railroad agreed, Gooding built the depot and a railroad conductor's wife was responsible for changing the name of the community, deciding Pickleville wasn't very fitting. She named it after a small tribe of Indians, the Paloma, a term which is also Spanish for dove.
