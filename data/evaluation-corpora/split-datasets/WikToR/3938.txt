Woodville is a community in Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, Canada. It is located west of Lindsay. Population is approx. 650. Known in the late 19th century as Irish Corners, the name of the town was changed to Woodville after the completion of the post office under postmaster John Morrison. In 1871 the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was built though the flourishing settlement and in 1878 Woodville became a police village. Woodville had a town hall, lock-up, grist-mill, two foundries, a cheese factory, planing mill and sash and door factory, a number of dry goods stores, mechanics' shops, and three hotels. It also had its own brick school house, with two teachers, and two churches â€“ one Presbyterian, the other Methodist. Today, the cheese factory, rail station, gristmill, mechanics shops, and hotels have all been shut down. Woodville now is home to a grocery store, three restaurants, two variety stores, a post office, one gas station, a bank, a curling rink and arena, two baseball diamonds and a newer school, first built in 1923.
