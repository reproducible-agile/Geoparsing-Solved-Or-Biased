Makrai is a village in the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The village was the headquarters of the Makrai princely state during the British Raj. According to legend the Makrai princely state was established in 1663 by Raj Gond Raja Karkat Rai in the 16th century. It later came under the administrative authority of the Central India Agency until 1933, when it was transferred to the Bhopal Agency subdivision of the Central India Agency in 1933 from the Central Provinces and Berar. In 1892, it covered an area of 401 square kilometres (155 sq mi) and had a population of 16,784. The state's rulers were of Rajput lineage and bore the title Maharaja. After Indian independence in 1947, the rulers of Makrai acceded to the Union of India, and the principality was incorporated into the state of Madhya Pradesh, which in turn was created from the former Central Provinces and Berar. As of 2012, the titular Maharaja of Makrai is Raja Ajay Shah, born on 21 January 1956, married on 20 May 1986 and crowned on 21 December 1987.
