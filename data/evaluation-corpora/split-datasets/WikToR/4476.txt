Gloucester (/ˈɡlɒstər/ GLOS-tər), a town in dairy and beef cattle country, is located in Gloucester Shire, within the Manning district on the Mid North Coast of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Gloucester is situated on the North Coast railway line and can be accessed from the southeast from Newcastle, located 145 kilometres (90 mi) via the Bucketts Way, or from the north via Thunderbolts Way. Gloucester River flows adjacent to the town, just above its junction with the Avon River. At the 2011 census, Gloucester had a population of 2,336 people. The Gloucester district was first visited by Robert Dawson, Chief Agent for the Australian Agricultural Company in 1826. Settlement occurred in the 1830s. The township of Gloucester was first established in 1855, primarily for sheep farming, however it became apparent that the land was not entirely suitable. The four main industries of the Gloucester area are: tourism, timber, cattle farming and more. The timber industry has been prevalent in Gloucester since the late 19th century, and it and cattle farming are still major industries in and around Gloucester; both dairy and beef cattle.
