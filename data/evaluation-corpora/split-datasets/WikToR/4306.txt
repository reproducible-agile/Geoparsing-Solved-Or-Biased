Cumberland is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 7,211 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area. Cumberland, Maine (also known as Cumberland Center), was once part of North Yarmouth, but in 1821, it was incorporated as its own town. The town was officially named by Ephraim Sturdivant when the new town government elected him to do the task. The Cumberland Fair, one of the state's larger agricultural fairs, has been held yearly in Cumberland at the end of September since 1868. This Portland suburb has a rich farming history, but only a small number of working farms remain, such as Sweetser's Apple Barrel & Orchards, Spring Brook Farms, and Double T Orchards. Chebeague Island, long a part of Cumberland, formed its own town in 2007. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 26.25 square miles (67.99 km2), of which 22.88 square miles (59.26 km2) of it is land and 3.37 square miles (8.73 km2) is water.
