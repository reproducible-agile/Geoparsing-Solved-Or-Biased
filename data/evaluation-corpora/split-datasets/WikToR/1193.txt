Milan (/ˈmaɪlən/ MY-lən) is a town in Coos County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,337 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Berlin, NH–VT Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city's name is pronounced differently from the English name for the Italian city of the same name. Neighboring Berlin also shares a similarly distinct pronunciation from its European namesake. Originally named Paulsburg in 1771 after Paul Wentworth, the town was incorporated on December 16, 1824. In that year, Governor Levi Woodbury authorized a name change to Milan, in honor of Milan Harris. Prior to 1820 there were but few inhabitants. In 1819 the population was about fourteen; ten years passed and the number had increased four-fold. Like the other towns around it, Milan's first industries were lumbering operations, and agriculture was for some time subordinate to this. The firms farms were developed on Milan hill. The soil was warmer, more free from frost, and, for some years, produced quite liberally in response to the labors of the pioneers. But they were not permanently as productive as they gave promise, and many of those settlers who remained south the most valuable lands along the river. Some of the names of the early pioneers of Milan include Ellingwood, Hodgdon, Fogg, Hinds, Roberts, Hagar, Sargent, Nay, Twitchell, and Newell.
