San Jose is a fifth-class municipality in the province of Romblon, Philippines. Its territory is contiguous with Carabao Island, otherwise known as Hambil Island, the southernmost island of the province. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 10,294 people. Throughout much of its Spanish and American colonial history, the island and its inhabitants repeatedly changed hands between the political jurisdictions of Romblon and Capiz provinces, before becoming a separate municipality of Romblon in 1969. Majority of the town's inhabitants speak Onhan, a Western Visayan language also spoken in some parts of Aklan in Panay Island. San Jose is located near the resort island of Boracay. The original settlers of the island were the Aetas, locally known as Ati or Ita who were believed to have descended from Orang Asli, the aboriginal people of the Malay Peninsula in mainland Asia. The aborigines came to the Philippines during the Paleolithic period by way of land bridges that connected the archipelago to mainland Asia. The Aetas settled in different parts of Panay Island and on the southern portion of Tablas Island, including Carabao Island where San Jose is located.
