Bedford, a suburb of Leigh, Greater Manchester is one of three ancient townships, Bedford, Pennington and Westleigh, that merged in 1875 to form the town of Leigh. Bedford was historically in Lancashire. Bedford means the "ford of Beda", which probably crossed the Pennington Brook near Beaston Bridge on Warrington Road. It was recorded as Beneford in 1200â€“21 and Bedeford in 1200 and 1296. There were several large houses or halls in the township. The manor was held of the Botelers of Warrington and was divided before the time from which records survive. Bedford Hall never assumed the role of a manor house and was occupied by tenants of the Kighleys who were absentee landlords. In 1301 half of the manor was held by the Kighleys, a quarter by the Sales who lived at the moated Hopecarr Hall and the rest by John Waverton of Brick House. Thomas Shuttleworth lived at Sandypool which was taken from the Kighley share. The area was largely rural and a small settlement grew at Butts where the road to Warrington branched from the Leigh to Manchester road. Several inns were situated near this junction and in 1641 there was a shop selling "cheese, gunpowder, hops, tobacco and a variety of other goods". There was a corn mill on the Breaston Brook.
