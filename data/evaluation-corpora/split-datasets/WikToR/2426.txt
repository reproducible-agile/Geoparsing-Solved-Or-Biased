Puli Township (Chinese: 埔里鎮; pinyin: Pǔlǐ zhèn; Wade–Giles: P'u3-li3 chen4; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Po·-lí tìn) is an urban township in Nantou County, Taiwan. It is the geographic center of Taiwan. In 1999, this town was damaged by the 921 earthquake. The damage was especially severe in Taomi Village a small rural village located within Puli Township. 10 years on, the village has since re-invented itself to be the pride of Taiwan's eco-tourism industry. Especially after the opening of the Paper Dome, now a major attraction in Puli Township, Taomi Village was transformed from a sleepy agricultural village to one that is busting with activities related to community redevelopment and eco-tourism. Since then, Taomi Village has seen vibrancy unprecedented since its glory days in the 1970s as an agricultural hub. There is a nationally owned brewery in the township. One of the main economic activities in Puli is tourism. It is located in the mountainous center of Taiwan, and many tourist destination spots are nearby. The nearest train station that serves Puli Township is the Checheng Station in Shuili Township.
