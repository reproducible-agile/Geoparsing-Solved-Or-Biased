Churchill is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,011 at the 2010 census. The town was named from the hilltop Beulah Presbyterian Church. Churchill is located at 40°26′18″N 79°50′38″W (40.438418, -79.843827). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2), all of it land. Churchill borders five other municipalities: Wilkinsburg, Penn Hills, Wilkins Township and Forest Hills. Interstate 376, known (to east of downtown Pittsburgh) as the "Parkway East" by native Pittsburghers, runs through Churchill. Westbound I-376 from Churchill goes to Interstate 279 and downtown Pittsburgh, while eastbound I-376 goes to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. In addition, U.S. Route 22 (on the same road as I-376) travels through Churchill. Several bus lines of the Port Authority of Allegheny County travel through Churchill, offering service to downtown Pittsburgh west of Churchill, and also to Monroeville east of Pittsburgh, where Monroeville Mall and several Port Authority park-and-ride lots for bus commuters are located. The Parkway East used to end at Churchill (in the traffic configuration just before it was extended to the Turnpike at Monroeville), with traffic having to continue ahead on U.S. 22—now business U.S. 22—to get from there to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. When the Parkway East ended there, there was a black-lettering-on-white-background sign "PARKWAY ENDS", because straight ahead there began to be grade-level intersections.
