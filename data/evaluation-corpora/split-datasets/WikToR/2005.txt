Medellin became a municipality by royal decree of Queen Isabel II of Spain on September 9, 1881. Medellin was formerly part of Daanbantayan. As a town, it started with only 3 barangays, namely; Kawit and Buenavista on the west coast, and Tindog on the east coast. Kawit, being the biggest and most progressive barangay at that time, became the first seat of government. But because of its deep shore water, the area was prone to pirates. As a consequence, the seat of government was then transferred to Buenavista (Daanlungsod). However, in view of its shallow shore water, traders and merchants found it difficult to transport their wares to and from Buenavista. A distance away south of Buenavista, there was a place called Tawagan which was an ideal site for trade and commerce. When the seat of government was transferred to Tawagan, the new poblacion was then called Medellin.
