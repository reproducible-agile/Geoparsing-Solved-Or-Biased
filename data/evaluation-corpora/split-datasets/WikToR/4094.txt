Benavides is a city in Duval County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,362 at the 2010 census, down from 1,686 at the 2000 census. The town is named after Plácido Benavides (1837–1919), namesake nephew of Plácido Benavides (1810–1837), Tejano 1832 alcalde of Victoria, who served under Stephen F. Austin with Juan Seguin, in the Siege of Béxar. Plácido Benavides whom the town is named after served in the Confederate States Army. After the war, he built his "Rancho Palo Alto" into one of the largest ranches in Duval County. In 1880, he agreed to let the county locate a railroad station on his property. In 1881, he donated 80 acres (32 ha) to establish the community that grew up around the station on the Texas Mexican Railway. In 1882 Archie Parr arrived to manage the Sweden Ranch for the Lott & Nielson Pasture Company. The former schoolteacher and ranch hand was later a rancher, Texas state senator, and the first "Duke of Duval", political boss of the county. His middle son, George Berham Parr, succeeded him as El Patrón and Duke of Duval. Other descendants of Archie also figured prominently in county politics. In 1911, Archie campaigned unsuccessfully to move the county courthouse from San Diego to Benavides.
