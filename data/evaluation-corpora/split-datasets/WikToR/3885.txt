Linton is a village 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south-west of Wetherby in West Yorkshire, England, in the parish of Collingham and the City of Leeds metropolitan borough. At the 2011 Census the village fell within the Harewood ward of the City of Leeds Council. It is situated between Wetherby and Sicklinghall, on the north bank of the River Wharfe. Collingham lies to the south on the opposite side of the river. Little is known of the early history of the village, but archaeologists have dated more than 8000 local flints to between 10,000 and 2000 BC, and crop marks around the village point to ditched enclosures and field systems in the Iron Age and Roman period (800 BC â€“ AD 410). Roman artifacts have been found and in 1936, a Roman burial site was identified to the north of the village. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it has a higher value than Wetherby. The Anglo-Saxon place name means "flax farm". There was a now-vanished medieval chapel in the village, possibly founded by the Percy family, once the landowners.
