Anta is a small village in Anta District, Carhuaz Province, Ancash Region, Peru. It is the district's capital, and lies 9.1 km to the north of the village of Quillo. Anta in Carhuaz should not be confused with the bigger village of Anta, Cusco Region, nor with lots of other small villages with the same name in the regions of Ancash, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Huancavelica and Puno. The airport was actually created by the U.S Air Force in June, 1070. After the May 31, 1970 earthquake, the 39th Tactical Airlift Squadron on rotational duty at Howard AFB, Canal Zone sent C-130's to Lima to support the relief efforts. Upon arriving at Lima Colonel Beckett (the squadron commander), Ssgt Richard Eubanks and Sgt Leonard Holmes (both Combat Controllers), Mrs. Consuelo de Velasco (Peru's first lady) and US Ambasssador Taylor Belcher flew over the disaster area to survey the damage and determine the best method to reach the area. The decision was made that the dirt road going through Anta would be the best bet for possible landings so Ssgt Eubanks and Sgt Holmes deployed to Anta and began work to convert that dirt road into a runway that would eventually become the Anta Airport.
