Arcadia is a semi-rural suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 42 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. Arcadia is in the Upper North Shore region. Arcadia is derived from Arcadia, a region in Greece and in Greek mythology was a pastoral retreat. Arcadia Post Office opened on 1 December 1895 (renamed from an earlier Upper Galston office) and closed in 1974. The name Dooral appeared on Surveyor James Meehanâ€™s map of April 1817 and originally covered the whole area which includes present day Arcadia, as well as Dural, Glenorie and Galston.
