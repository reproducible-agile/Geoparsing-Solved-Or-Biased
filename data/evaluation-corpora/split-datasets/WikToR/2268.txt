Lincoln County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2010 census, the population was 33,361. Its county seat and largest city is Fayetteville. The county is named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln, an officer in the American Revolutionary War. Lincoln County was created in 1809 from parts of Bedford County. The land occupied by the county was part of a land session obtained from the Cherokee and Chickasaw in 1806. The Lincoln County Process, used in the distillation of Tennessee whiskey, is named for this county, as Jack Daniel's distillery was originally located there. However, a subsequent redrawing of county lines resulted in the establishment of adjacent Moore County, where it is now located, so no current Lincoln County business uses its namesake process. The governing body of Lincoln County is the Lincoln County Commission, which is divided into eight districts and 24 commissioners, three from each district. The body is chaired by the County Mayor. The government center of Lincoln County is the Lincoln County Courthouse in Fayetteville. National Register of Historic Places listings in Lincoln County, Tennessee
