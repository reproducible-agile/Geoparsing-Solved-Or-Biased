Detroit (pronounced "dee-troit" by local residents) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Dickinson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 114. It was named after Detroit, Michigan. In the early years of the county, Detroit was once strongly considered to be the county seat because Abilene was considered to be "too wild" of a town to serve as a center of government. However, Abilene became the county seat and Detroit ceased to grow from that point forward. A post office was opened in Detroit in 1866, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1961. Detroit was a station on the Union Pacific Railroad. Detroit is located halfway between Abilene and Chapman, 2 miles (3 km) north of Enterprise. The town is at an elevation of 1,147 feet (350 m) above sea level. Detroit is a "square" town, two blocks long and two blocks wide. The three north-south streets are Main, Middle, and School. The three east-west streets are First, Second, and Third. There are no more streets in Detroit. All six streets are unpaved.
