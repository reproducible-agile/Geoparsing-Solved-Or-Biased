Burlington is a city in Ward County, North Dakota, United States. Burlington was founded in 1883, having been third in a series that included two earlier settlements. Despite this, Burlington is still the oldest city in Ward County, as well as north-western and north central North Dakota. In 1885, as it was the only city in the then-newly formed Imperial Ward County (now split into Ward, Renville, Mountrail, and Burke counties), it was given the county seat, a position it held until 1888. The population was 1,060 at the 2010 census. Burlington is part of the Minot Micropolitan Statistical Area. Burlington, and its former settlements were founded by James Johnson and James Colton (the men who also settled Larimore, North Dakota) in Dakota Territory in the late 1870s. Earlier settlements were The Forks, and later Colton (named after James Colton), which are considered forerunners of the city. Its current name was given to it by James Johnson during the creation of the post office, and was the name of his hometown of Burlington, Iowa. The name "The Forks" is used as a nickname for Burlington, both alluding to its heritage, as well as its geographic location at the confluence of the Des Lacs and Souris Rivers. One of the first buildings in Burlington, the first 'Ward County Courthouse'; built by James Johnson, and used originally as a granary; was moved to the North Dakota State Fair fairgrounds in the mid-20th century and now serves as one of the 2 buildings of the Ward County Historical Society`s Fairgrounds Museum. In the early 1890s, the Burlington Reporter became the first newspaper in western North Dakota. It would in the future be renamed to the Minot Daily News. On June 24, 2011, the entire city was evacuated when floodwaters wiped through the town.
