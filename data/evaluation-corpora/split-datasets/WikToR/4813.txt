Middleton is a civil parish in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The parish is centred on Milton Keynes Village, the village that gave its name to the 'New City' of Milton Keynes, which began to be developed during the late 1960s. The Village also gives its name to the local civil parish, of which Middleton is the more populated district. The village was originally known as Middeltone (11th century); then later as Middelton Kaynes or Caynes (13th century); Milton Keynes (15th century); and Milton alias Middelton Gaynes (17th century). After the Norman invasion, the de Cahaines family held the manor from 1166 to the late 13th century as well as others in the country (Ashton Keynes, Somerford Keynes, and Horsted Keynes). During this time the village became known as Middleton de Keynes eventually shortening to Milton Keynes. The original core village of the district, along Walton Road and Broughton Road, has retained its "Milton Keynes" road signs and has an attractive collection of rural village houses and a thatched pub which dates back to the 13th century. It is now known as "Milton Keynes Village".
