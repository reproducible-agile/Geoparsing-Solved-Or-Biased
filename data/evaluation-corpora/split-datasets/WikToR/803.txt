Fortuna is a city in Divide County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 22 at the 2010 census. Fortuna was founded in 1913 along a Soo Line Railroad branch line running between Flaxton, North Dakota and Whitetail, Montana. The name comes from the Roman goddess of fortune and was chosen by railroad officials to note the settlers' expectations of prosperity with the arrival of the railroad. The city is located 6 miles from the Canadian border and is the northernmost city on U.S. Route 85 before it crosses into Canada at Port of Oungre, Saskatchewan. Fortuna, North Dakota has the latest sunset time on the summer solstice (June 23) in the contiguous, lower 48 States. The sun sets at 10:03 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT). This is due to Fortuna's location at the far western edge of the Central Time Zone. Although other communities in the lower 48 States are located farther north, none of them are located as far west in their respective time zones. Fortuna's westerly location in the time zone gives it the latest local time when the sun sets on the summer solstice.
