Cleveland is a city in Bolivar County, Mississippi. The population was 12,334 as of the 2010 census. Cleveland has a fairly large commercial economy, with numerous restaurants, stores, and services along U.S. Route 61. Cleveland is one of the two county seats (the other being Rosedale) of Bolivar County, which was named for the South American liberator Simon Bolivar. Named after President Grover Cleveland, the town began formation in 1869 as people moved inland from the Mississippi River. The Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railroad ran through the town and a portion of the railroad remains there today. Early records show the community was called Fontaine in 1884 and at some point Coleman's Station. Moses W. Coleman built the first home on the bayou in the area. In 1885, it was officially named Sims after Rueben T. Sims, who owned part of the land on which the town stood. The village of Cleveland was chartered on March 25, 1886, and the United States Post Office recognized the town as such on August 5, 1887. It was Sims's son, B.C. Sims, who was responsible for the name change to Cleveland.
