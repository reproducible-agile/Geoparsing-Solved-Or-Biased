Gordon is a village in the old county of Berwickshire, Scotland and is now part of the Scottish Borders Council. The village sits on the crossroads of the A6106 Earlston to Duns road and the A6089 Edinburgh to Kelso road, it is 6 miles east of Earlston and 4 miles west of Greenlaw at grid reference NT64764306 Gordon was once on a branch line of the Berwickshire Railway. The first Gordon on record is Richard of Gordon, previously of Swinton, said to have been the grandson of a famous knight who slew some monstrous animal in the Merse during the time of King Malcolm III of Scotland. This Richard was Lord of the Barony of Gordon in the Merse. The name is said to derive from the Gaelic 'Gor Dun' meaning great fort. The de Gordons held the lairdship of Gordon for over two centuries and were thought to have built a castle at the former hamlet of Huntly just to the north; they still held lands up to the 18th century. The Gordon family are the ancestors of the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon and of the Marquis of Huntly.
