According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.8 square miles (9.8 km2), all of it land. Ramah was one of fifty locations settled in the New Mexico Territory under the direction of Brigham Young, a notable prophet within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and is one of only three that still remain today. Ramah was originally settled by Mormon pioneers for the purpose of missionary work to be carried out within the Zuni and Navajo communities. Ramah Lake was built by these same Mormon pioneers in order to farm the surrounding area, which receives little rainfall on a yearly basis. This trait is shared by many areas in the state of New Mexico. Ramah lies between the Zuni Indian Reservation, the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation, and the Cibola National Forest. Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary, El Morro National Monument, and El Malpais National Monument are all located near the Ramah area.
