Dingle (known locally as the Dingle) is an inner-city area of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is located to the south of the city, bordered by the adjoining districts of Toxteth and Aigburth. At the 2001 Census, the population was recorded at 13,246. Dingle is an area entirely within the boundaries of the old Toxteth Park. It is named after Dingle Brook (Dingle meaning a wooded valley), which rose at High Park Street and roughly followed Park Road, towards the Old Toxteth Chapel, just south of Dingle Lane and entered the River Mersey at Knott's Hole, which was a narrow bay or inlet next to where the Dingle flowed out to the Mersey. On either side were steep rocky cliffs, with Dingle Point to the south west. In the 1850s the Dingle area was purely rural. Liverpool lay to the north west, but this was an area of large houses, vast gardens, babbling streams and a long beach. It was a mainly Protestant area which developed from the influx of Welsh settlers, whilst the north end of Liverpool such as Everton and Vauxhall was settled by Irish immigrants, and became mainly Catholic.
