Chalai Bazaar (Chala Market) is an old shopping area in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The market is spread through the narrow 2 km road connecting Killippalam and East Fort, which runs from East to West. The by-lanes too have an array of shops. There is virtually nothing that is not available in Chala, from fruits and vegetables, gold and silver to paint and hardware. Most shops are open from 9 am to 8 pm daily except Sundays. The place gets very crowded in the evenings. A number of good eateries also dot the area. Chalai Market was officially established towards the end of 18th century by Raja Kesavadas, Dewan of Travancore. The idea was to make Chalai bazar the central point for the supply of commodities to the Travancore kingdom. The Killi and Karamana rivers nearby was used to transport goods to the market. Chalai market is located opposite to the East fort central bus stand where all the city buses terminate. The main entrance is located at the junction between Gandhi park and KSRTC bus garage.The approach from East Fort is right in the city centre. It is well connected to all parts of the city.
