Richland is a city in Keokuk County, Iowa, United States. The population was 584 at the 2010 census. Richland is located at 41°11′6″N 91°59′38″W (41.184899, -91.993871). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.77 square miles (1.99 km2), all of it land. Richland had its own elementary and secondary school, which was constructed in the 1920s. In 1959, after much local controversy, Richland was incorporated into the Pekin Community School System. The high schools in Richland, Ollie, Packwood, and Farson were closed, although the buildings associated with them continued to be used for elementary and junior high school students. All the high school students from these four towns, along with all the rural areas which had been associated with these separate school systems, were then educated at a new building located near Pekin. In 1970, a further consolidation eliminated the local junior high schools and replaced them with a consolidated middle school in Packwood: all students in grades six through eight began to go to Packwood, and, thereafter, the Richland school building was used only for elementary students (kindergarten through fifth grade) from Richland and its associated rural areas, including Rubio. Elementary students from elsewhere in the district went to Ollie, and the Farson school was closed. In this consolidation, all middle school students went to Packwood.
