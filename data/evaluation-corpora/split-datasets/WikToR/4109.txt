Floyd County is a county located along the northwest border of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 96,317. The county seat is Rome. Floyd County comprises the Rome, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 518 square miles (1,340 km2), of which 510 square miles (1,300 km2) is land and 8.6 square miles (22 km2) (1.7%) is water. The northern third of Floyd County is located in the Oostanaula River sub-basin of the ACT River Basin (Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin). The eastern third of the county is located in the Etowah River sub-basin of the larger ACT River Basin, while the western third of Floyd County is located in the Upper Coosa River sub-basin of the same ACT River Basin. The county government is housed in the Floyd County Administration Building in Rome, Georgia, the county seat. This was the former US Post Office and Courthouse. The county has a council-manager form of government, with five county council members elected at-large. Two members are elected as representatives of the city of Rome and must reside there; the other three are elected from the county as residents outside the city limits. The at-large voting tends to reward candidates who can muster majority votes from across the whole county, which requires more money and organization for campaigns. This system makes it difficult for minorities to elect representatives of their choice. The council hires a professional county manager to manage daily operations.
