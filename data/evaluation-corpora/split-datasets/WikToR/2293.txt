Its raja, during the freedom struggle, had been an important member of the Muslim League and a close friend of Jinnah. In 1962, he migrated to Pakistan, leaving his young son and heir behind in Lucknow. The vast Mahmudabad properties in UP were then seized as "enemy property" under defence rules. When the old raja died in London in 1974, his son Raja Mohammad Amir Khan began a long legal battle to get back his inheritance. In a landmark judgement in Sep 2005, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to release the Mahmudabad properties and restore them to the present raja. The properties include Butler Palace and large chunks of Hazratganj in Lucknow, the Metropole Hotel in Nainital and much of Sitapur town.
