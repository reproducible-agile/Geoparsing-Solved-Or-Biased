Arlington is a city in northern Snohomish County, Washington, United States, bordered by the city of Marysville to the south. The population was 17,926 at the 2010 census. Arlington was platted by European Americans in 1900, and was named after Lord Henry Arlington, a member of Charles II of England's cabinet. Haller City was a nearby town founded April 24, 1890, by Theodore Haller and his parents Henrietta and Granville O. Haller.  When Arlington was incorporated as a city in May 5, 1903, it included Haller City. The city is home to the Stillaguamish Valley Pioneer Museum. Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by Indigenous Americans, whose descendants identify as the Stillaquamish Tribe. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system, Arlington has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). From its founding, Arlington was dependent on timber harvesting and timber products. It was once dubbed the "Shingle Capital of the World" owing to the shingle mills, sawmills, and logging camps in the vicinity. Historically, Arlington was a railroad town with several different rail connections. It was located on the Northern Pacific(NP) mainline that stretched from the Canadian border through Sedro-Woolley to Snohomish. Arlington also had a branch line running east to Darrington that primarily carried timber products. Both of these lines were abandoned by NP's successor Burlington Northern in the 1980s due to declining industry. While it is not as rail dependent as it once was, Arlington still maintains a rail connection with BNSF Railways via a spur line. Remnants of Arlington's railroad history can still be seen with the various trestles and signal equipment still in place. Snohomish County is in the process of converting the abandoned rail right of way into bike/hike trails.
