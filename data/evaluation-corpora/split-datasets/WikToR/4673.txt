Warburton is a town in Victoria, Australia, 72 kilometres east of Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2011 census, Warburton had a population of 2,171. The name "Warburton" has been shared between two townships over the years. The mining town of "Yankee Jim's Creek" was located on the gold-bearing slopes of Mount Little Joe, and was renamed "Warburton" after the mining warden of the district, Charles Warburton Carr. Gold depletion caused a declining population in the 1880s, so the town was renamed "Old Warburton" and the town of "Upper Warburton" on the banks on the Yarra River was renamed "Warburton". The Post Office opened around 1884. Two earlier offices named Warburton were renamed as Launching Place and Hoddle's Creek. Warburton was connected to Lilydale by a Victorian Railways branch line, which was closed in 1965. The railway path is now used for the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail, a rail trail used by pedestrians, cyclists, and horse-riders.
