Within its chancel chapel is a 14th-century tomb, supposed to be that of Sir Richard de Belwood. Grade II listed Hirst Priory is on or near the site of a monastic cell at Hirst. In the early 12th century the lands for the cell were granted by Nigel d'Albini to the Austin canons of Nostell Priory. The cell, which was extant until the 16th century, housed a single canon to oversee the priory's property and tithes. The house was built in the 18th century, with later additions in the 19th.
