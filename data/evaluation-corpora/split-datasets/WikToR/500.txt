Miramar is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 122,041. It is part of the South Florida metropolitan area, which was home to 5,564,635 people at the 2010 census. Miramar was founded by A.L. Mailman to serve as a “bedroom community" for nearby Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Mr. Mailman bought the original property he was to develop from H.D. Perry, Sr. in 1953. He built 56 homes on the property that were inexpensive homes of concrete and flat roofs. These homes sold quickly because of the low cost of both the homes and the land, and the city of Miramar came into being. The City of Miramar was incorporated on May 26, 1955. At the time of incorporation, the city had a population of less than two hundred people. With approximately 2.9 square miles land area, Miramar's original city boundaries were Southwest 64 Avenue on the east, University Drive on the west, the Dade County line on the south, and Pembroke Road on the north. On June 20th, 1955, the city's first mayor and city council were sworn in, all of which were appointed by the governor and served until January 1959 at which time the first municipal election was held. Robert Gordon, the first mayor of the city gave Miramar its name which translates to “Look at the Sea” in Spanish. "Miramar" was an exclusive suburb of Havana in pre-Castro Cuba. The city seal is inscribed with the motto “Beauty and Progress".
