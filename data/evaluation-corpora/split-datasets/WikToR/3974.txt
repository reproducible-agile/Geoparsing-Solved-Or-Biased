For the fictional city within the Elder Scrolls universe, see Bruma, Cyrodiil. Bruma is a 20-year-old suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. It is noted for a small lake (being treated to reduce water-borne pollution), and for its popular flea market which sold souvenirs from across Africa. The old flea market was closed due to the development of Chinese mall. Around 50 art and craft traders operate from nearby Oppenheimer Street and continues to attract many visitors and tourists. The area surrounding Bruma Lake has been redeveloped in the last few years. It has a small mall known as Asia City. The mall mainly sells goods imported from Asia. The main shopping centre in the area is Eastgate shopping centre, Johannesburg, which is one of the largest shopping centres in Johannesburg. Excellent transport links serve Bruma with the R24 (Gauteng), N12 (South Africa) and N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa) highways all easily accessible. The R24 highway leads directly to Johannesburg Airport (approximately 15 minutes drive from Bruma). The residential area is renowned for compact, beautiful houses and townhouses.
