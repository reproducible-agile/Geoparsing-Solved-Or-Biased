Kingston is a Canadian village in Kings County on the north bank of the Annapolis River in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, Canada. As of 2011, the population was 5,174. This village is home to Clairmont Provincial Park. It is a small picnic park near the Fundy Shore. This parkâ€™s picnic area is situated under a stand of red pine, providing a cool oasis away from the valley heat. Kingston remains as a major service centre for the apple growing industry in the area of western Kings County and has a growing retail district, owing to its access to Highway 101. The land which Kingston sits on today was originally owned by Bishop Inglis, the first Anglican Bishop of Nova Scotia, granted to him in 1790. By the early 1800s he had sold off most of the land along the Annapolis River, converted into farm lots. The small community centered on these farms was at first called "Bloomfield", but the name "Kingston Station" was given to it in 1868 when the Halifax-Yarmouth main line of the Dominion Atlantic Railway was built and passed through the community, with its station being meant to serve the neighboring communities of Kingston Village (now known as Greenwood) and North Kingston. After the arrival of the railway, Kingston Station developed into a local service and light manufacturing centre.
