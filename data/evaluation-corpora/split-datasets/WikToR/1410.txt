Augusta Township is a township in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville; located in eastern Ontario, Canada. Augusta is situated along the Saint Lawrence River, and extends back into rural hamlets. The township is located between the city of Brockville to the west, and the town of Prescott to the east. The hamlets and villages within Augusta were established prior to the 1900s; primarily by the United Empire Loyalists. There are plenty of buildings and homes still standing in the township today that were built by early settlers; many of these historic homes are even still occupied by direct descendants of the first settlers. In 2013, it was discovered that Samuel Bass, the Canadian abolitionist mentioned in Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir 12 Years a Slave, was from Augusta township. According to early census records, Bass was born in Augusta in 1807; while here, he married Lydia Catlin Lane, with whom he fathered four children. His wife and children remained in the area, and some of his descendants still reside here to this day. Bass' grandparents were among the first Loyalists to settle in the area, and his parents are buried at Maynard.
