Cori is a town and comune in the province of Latina, in the Lazio region of central Italy. Cori was well developed in the age of the expansion of Rome (7th-6th century BC). It became a Roman possession after the Social War (90–88 BC), maintaining some administrative and political autonomy. In the Middle Ages Cori, which suffered a steep decadence in the early centuries of that age, was often allied with its neighbour Velletri. It was a possession of the Annibaldi until 1234, when it went back to the Papal suzerainty, under which (apart a short period under Ladislaus of Naples in 1400–10) remained until the unification of Italy. It is part of the province of Latina since 1934. The hills around Cori is permitted to produce both red and white Italian DOC wine, with the region producing more white wines. Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 16 tonnes/ha with finished white wines needing a minimum alcohol level of 11% and finished reds needing 11.5%. The white wines are a blend of up to 70% Malvasia di Candia, up to 40% Trebbiano and up to 30% of Bellone and Giallo. The reds are composed of 40-60% Montepulciano and 20-40% Nero Buono, 10-30% Cesanese.
