Riverton (Arapaho: Hóóxonó'oo) is a city in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States. The city's population was 10,615 at the 2010 census. The city is an incorporated entity of the state of Wyoming. The community was named Riverton because of the four rivers that meet there. The town was built on land ceded from the Wind River Reservation in 1906, a situation that often makes it subject to jurisdictional claims by the nearby Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes. Recent legal rulings indicate the land may have been sold but not ceded...(BIA Solicitor Opinion, October, 2011) In December 2013, the US Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Interior and Department of Justice found Riverton to be a part of the Wind River Indian Reservation.
