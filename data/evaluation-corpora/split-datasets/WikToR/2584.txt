Armstrong is a compact rural community, unincorporated place, and divisional point on the Canadian National Railway transcontinental railway main line in the unorganized portion of Thunder Bay District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The Whitesand First Nation's Armstrong Settlement is coterminous to this community. The Armstrong area is a popular tourist destination in the summer for fishing and hunting. The community is not part of an incorporated municipality, but is administered by a local services board. Armstrong is accessible via Highway 527, which extends 235 kilometres (146 mi) north from Highway 11/17 near Thunder Bay. It takes about three hours to get to Armstrong by car from Thunder Bay. According to the Canada 2011 Census, the community had a population of 220, down from 276 in 2006, a decrease of 20.3%. There are 184 dwellings of which 91 are occupied by usual residents. Canadian Forces Station Armstrong, located 1.1 miles (1.8 km) east of Armstrong, was closed in 1974. Later that year it was bought out and turned into a popular gathering area for the town featuring a restaurant and bar, hotel, multiple apartments, and a curling rink. The area, known as D&L, was closed and abounded in 1993 and remains that way today.
