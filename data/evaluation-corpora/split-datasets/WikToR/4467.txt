The local area is home to numerous other German communities such as Hollenberg, Hermansburg, Frankfort, and Bremen. The "Hollenberg Station" became an important hub along the way for Pony Express travelers and he eventually established a grocery and stage depot on his farm in 1858. The Hollenberg farm housed nine boarding rooms, and the success of "Hollenberg Station" as a business attracted more people to the area and many settled alongside the Hollengbergs in the decade leading up to the establishment of Hanover. Prior to the establishment of the town, in 1868 a school district was established in the area to satisfy the need to educate children of settlers who continued to arrive near the "Hollenberg Station."
