Warren is a town in Bristol County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 10,611 at the 2010 census. Warren was the site of the Indian village of Sowams on the peninsula called Pokanoket (the near parts now called Mount Hope Neck), and was first explored by Europeans Edward Winslow and Stephen Hopkins in 1621. By the next year, Plymouth Colony had established a trading post at Sowams. In 1623, Winslow and John Hampden saved the life of Wampanoag Sachem Massasoit with medicine, gaining an important native ally. In 1636, Roger Williams was banished from Salem and fled to Sowams, where he was sheltered by Massasoit until he settled at Providence, Rhode Island. Permanent English settlement began east of the Indian village. In 1653, Massasoit and his oldest son sold to certain Plymouth Colony settlers what is now Warren and parts of Barrington, Rhode Island, Swansea, Massachusetts, and Rehoboth, Massachusetts. After the death of Massasoit, relations became strained between the Indians and the settlers, leading to King Philip's War in 1675. The English settlement at Sowams was destroyed during the war but was rebuilt.
