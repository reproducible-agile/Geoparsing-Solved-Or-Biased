El Zapotal is a Totonac culture archaeological site, located in the region known as Mixtequilla, between the Blanco and Papaloapan rivers in the Ignacio de la llave Municipality in the Veracruz State, Mexico. Its finding has great significance for the understanding of ancient cultures of Veracruz and Mexico. It is considered that site was inhabited by the Totonac culture, grandiose pottery pieces were found, among these figures is the Mictlantecuhtli sculpture, God of death. The various sculptures were accompanied by an ossuary composed of hundreds of ceramic figures, among them are the so-called smiling faces and a set of women with naked torso, these were called "The ladies of the Earth", as representations of Cihuateotl figurines. El Zapotal is currently located on an ancient totonac city in ruins, which flourished in 600 to 900 CE, in what archaeologists call the "classical" period. El Zapotal is a great Totonac site whose apogee seems to have occurred at the end of the late classical and early postclassical period. Although it contains many buildings, (as is typical in Mexico) only a few have been explored.
