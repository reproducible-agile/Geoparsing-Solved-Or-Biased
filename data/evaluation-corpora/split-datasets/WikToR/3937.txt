Woodville is a village and civil parish 1.5 miles east of Swadlincote in South Derbyshire, England. The centre of the village, known as the Tollgate, is a busy traffic island on the A511. Woodville forms part of the border with Leicestershire. Formerly known as Wooden Box, named after the wooden toll booth on the toll road between Ashby de la Zouch and Burton-upon-Trent. The area around the roundabout, which is the modern equivalent of the toll booth, is still known as 'Tollgate'. The name Woodville first appeared in a leaflet issued when the foundation stone of the Church of England parish church of Saint Stephen was laid on 7 November 1845. St. Stephen's is a Norman revival building designed by H.I. Stevens and completed in 1846. The Woodville area is rich in industrial heritage with a wide variety of industries such as potteries, crate-making, pipe works, breweries, rope-making and railways all having had a presence in the area which is now either totally gone or extremely diminished. One of the most famous Woodville potteries was Bretby Art Pottery founded in 1882 by Henry Tooth and William Ault.
