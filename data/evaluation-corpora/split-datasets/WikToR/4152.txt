Rakita (Greek: Ρακίτα) is a location in the municipal unit Leontio, Achaea, Greece. It is part of the community of Ano Mazaraki. It is located at an altitude of about 1,100 m in a plateau near mount Barbas and it is surrounded by fir forests and mountain views. In recent years and because of the improved road access it has seen an increase in the number of tourists. During recent excavations in the region of Rakita an ancient temple of geometric period sacred to the Goddess Artemis was discovered. Also in the settlement lies the historic old church of Agia Paraskevi (built in 1700) where the Greek rebels under Theodoros Kolokotronis attended the divine liturgy just before the crucial victorious battle in Kafkaria against the Turkish general Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt.
