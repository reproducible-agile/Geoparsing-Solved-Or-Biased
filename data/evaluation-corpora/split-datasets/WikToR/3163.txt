Lowell is a town in West Creek and Cedar Creek townships, Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 9,276 at the 2010 census. Lowell was platted in 1853. It was named after Lowell, Massachusetts. Lowell is located at 41°18′N 87°25′W (41.2924, −87.4151). According to the 2010 census, Lowell has a total area of 5.27 square miles (13.65 km2), of which 5.18 square miles (13.42 km2) (or 98.29%) is land and 0.09 square miles (0.23 km2) (or 1.71%) is water. Located five miles outside of the Great Lakes Basin, Lowell sought permission to pipe in lake water to replace city water drawn from its high fluoride deep wells. However, diversion of water out of the Great Lakes requires the approval of the Great Lakes Commission, which includes representatives of all the US states and Canadian provinces that border on the lakes. Lowell's request was turned down in 1991. Lowell lies on the Valparaiso Moraine, almost on the Kankakee Outwash Plain. The town also lies near the St. Lawrence Seaway Divide.
