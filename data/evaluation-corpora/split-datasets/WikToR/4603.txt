Bradford is a working-class village in southwest Rhode Island where the Bradford Dyeing Association (BDA) has operated for nearly 100 years. BDA is the largest producer of battle dress uniform fabrics to the U.S. Dept. of Defense. In violation of the federal Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, the BDA plant polluted the Pawcatuck River and fouled the local air. The RI DEM (Department of Environmental Management) was not responding to local complaints about the contamination so the Bradford Coalition 2 Stop Pollution, a community group of homeowners and tenants, lobbied to reduce BDA's pollution.
