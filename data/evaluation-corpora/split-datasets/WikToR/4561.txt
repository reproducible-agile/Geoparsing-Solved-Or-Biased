Andes is a town in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 1,301 at the 2010 census. The town of Andes contains a hamlet (formerly a village) also named Andes. The town is on the southeast border of the county. Settlement began in 1784. The town was formed in 1819 from the town of Middletown. In 1845 in what became known as the Anti-Rent War, protesters, several hundred dressed as "Calico Indians", shot and killed Under-Sheriff Osman Steele, when he and deputies attempted to collect overdue rent of about $64. Hundreds of protesters were arrested and two were sentenced to death, but their sentences were later commuted. On December 31, 2003, the incorporated village of Andes ceased to exist. During a special village election on June 3, 2002, the residents approved dissolving the village by a vote of 81 to 63. The Jackson-Aitken Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Andes is located in southeastern Delaware County on the western edge of the Catskill Mountains. The south town line is the border of Ulster County. Andes is partly in the Catskill Park.
