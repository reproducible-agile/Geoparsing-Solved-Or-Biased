Trenton is a city in Dade County, Georgia, United States. Founded in 1830 by European Americans, the area was originally known as Salem. In 1839 Salem was designated the seat of the newly formed Dade County. It was renamed Trenton in 1841. The population was 2,301 at the 2010 census. It is the only incorporated municipality in the county, and as such it serves as the county seat. Trenton is part of the Chattanooga, Tennesseeâ€“GA Metropolitan Statistical Area. On April 27, 2011, an EF-3 tornado with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) hit the city, causing significant damage and loss of life. This was historically part of Cherokee people territory before Georgia and the United States forced them to cede lands and, under Indian Removal Act, relocate to Indian Territory in the 1830s. The area was developed largely for subsistence farming. The noted Southern humorist George Washington Harris (1814-1869) is buried in the Brock Cemetery in Trenton. Although he was considered one of the seminal writers of Southern humor and greatly influenced the literary works of Mark Twain, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor, his grave was not officially identified and marked with a monument until 2008.
