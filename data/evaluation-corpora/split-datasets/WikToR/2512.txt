Guanting (Chinese: 官亭; pinyin: Guāntíng) is a town in eastern Qinghai province, People's Republic of China. It is located in the southeast of Minhe County and, together with Guanting, Zhongchuan, Xiakou, Gangou and Xin'er townships, is referred to as the Guanting Area (官亭地区). It is the home to the most densely populated Tu Zu settlement in China, who refer to the area as "Sanchuan" (三川). The official Chinese name for the area is Guanting (官亭). Local legends accounted that the name came from the famous general, Guan Yu (关羽), who stopped by in the area on his way to look for his sworn brother, Liu Bei, the founder of the Shu Han Kingdom (221-263) in the southwest, after having left Cao Cao of the Cao Wei Kingdom (220-265) in China proper. The Chinese name "Guan" in Guanting came from the last name of Guan Yu, whereas "Ting" came from the Chinese character for "stop" (停) or "pavilion" (亭).
