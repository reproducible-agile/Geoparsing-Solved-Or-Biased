The Mat Salleh Memorial, located in the middle of paddy fields at Kampung Tibabar (Tibabar Village), is a concrete structure erected by the state government in memory of Datu Paduka Mat Salleh. Better known as Mat Salleh, he led a rebellion against the British North Borneo Company in the late 19th century in response to the locals' dissatisfaction with alleged exploitation by the Company. He was killed in a gun battle with the British police on 1 February 1900. The memorial was erected on the spot where Mat Salleh was killed after Sabah became part of Malaysia.
