Silian, originally Sulien, is a village in the valley of the River Aeron, Ceredigion, Wales. It is located approximately two miles north-west of Lampeter, on a minor road connecting Pont Creuddun on the A482, and Glan Denys on the A485. In January 2014, permission was granted for a wind turbine in Silian, in the face of strong local opposition. The county council, deciding a site visit for an area that is home to rare red kite birds was not required, were enthusiastic to help "secure local business." Silian is also the name of the parish, which takes its name from Saint Sulien, to whom the village church is consecrated. Bethel Chapel was built in Silian in 1654, and renovated in 1952. Julian Cayo-Evans, the Welsh nationalist and leader of the Free Wales Army, was born in Silian in 1937. Silian Halt was on the Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway, opening in 1911 and closing to passengers in 1951. A local Welsh language paper, Llais Aeron, covers the area. Self-catering accommodation and B&Bs are available in the village, which is conveniently situated for visiting the towns of Lampeter, Aberaeron and Aberystwyth.
