Buin, a town on Bougainville Island, and the capital of the South Bougainville District, in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, in eastern Papua New Guinea. The island is in the northern Solomon Islands Archipelago of the Melanesia region, in the South Pacific Ocean. It is a government-established town in the jungle, now inland from the coast, where its sea landing predecessor of the same name was located. The town is in an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea established in 2000, and was the former North Solomons Province (1976-2000). Buin and Bougainville Island gained world attention with the 1942 Japanese invasion and subsequent Allied Bougainville Campaign in World War II. After the war, the present day town of Buin was established, inland to the north from its original location, which had been a minimal point of sea-landing on the coast. In the late 1960s Buin became a regional centre of government, commercial, and education activity. After Bougainville Copper Ltd. was established, it came to national prominence as the source of a large proportion of the country's financial base. The town was isolated from contact and commercial activity during the 1990s Bougainville Civil War. In 2000 it became within the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, upon the Autonomous Region's establishment.
