Milton is a district in the Scottish city of Glasgow, situated north of the River Clyde. The housing scheme is about 2.5 miles north of Glasgow City Centre. The construction of Milton started in the late 1940s as a part of a general post-war construction programme by Glasgow Corporation to deal with the housing shortages and slum clearances. The district is bordered to the south and east by Ashgill Road. It is also bordered by Liddesdale Road, which had previously connected Colston to Balmore Road. The new streets were named after the Scottish islands: Berneray, Birsay, Castlebay, Cathay, Egilsay, Longay, Mingulay, Ornsay, Raasay, Ronaldsay, Scalpay, Scaraway, Shilay Skerray, Stornoway, Torogay, Vallay and Westray. The area had only a few private homes (in Liddesdale Road/Birsay Road and Loskin Drive) prior to the new development. The scheme was completed in 1952, but further housing was added in later years, including high-rise flats in Castlebay Drive in the late 1960s. Housing styles varied from gray stone apartment houses with back and front doors, to brown or white clad pre-fabricated apartment housing, and 4 storey flats of 8 units each, some with open verandas. All housing was rented social housing.
