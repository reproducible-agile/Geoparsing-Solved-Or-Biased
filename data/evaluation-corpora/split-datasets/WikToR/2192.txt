Stockton is a small village and civil parish in the Wylye Valley in Wiltshire, England, about 8 miles (13 km) southeast of Warminster. The parish includes the hamlet of Bapton. The village is close to Codford, south of the A36 road, between the town of Warminster and the city of Salisbury. When the civil parish of Fisherton Delamere was extinguished in 1934, the portion south of the Wylye (1,174 acres) was transferred to Stockton. This transfer included Bapton and Fisherton Mill, in the village of Fisherton Delamere. Stockton also has two cottages some three miles from the main village street at a remote spot called Great Bottom. St John the Baptist's Church, Stockton, is largely unrestored and in the south aisle has an early 14th-century stone effigy of a lady, believed to be the foundress of the chantry for which this aisle was built. In the north aisle is a canopied tomb of John and Mary Topp. Parts of the building date from the late 12th-century. It is a Grade I listed building. Stockton has one pub, The Carriers, in the main village street.
