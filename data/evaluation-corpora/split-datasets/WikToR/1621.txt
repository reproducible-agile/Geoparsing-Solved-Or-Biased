Newport is a large village in Essex near Saffron Walden. The village has a population of just over 2,000, measured at 2,352 at the 2011 census. Located approximately 41 miles (66 kilometres) north of London, the village is situated amongst the arable fields of northern Essex. With a regular train service to London Liverpool Street and Cambridge from the Newport (Essex) railway station, the village is considered to be within commuting distance of the capital and as such attracts a number of workers from the City of London. Joyce Frankland Academy, a comprehensive co-educational secondary school, is also located in the village. Newport is the centre point of the long-distance path known as "The Harcamlow Way", a figure-of-eight walk between Cambridge and Harlow. Consequently, it has a large number of walks radiating from its centre; short walks of surrounding interest include those heading towards Saffron Walden, the English Heritage property of Audley End House, or Prior Hall Barn in Widdington. A settlement may have existed here under the name Wigingamere which King Edward the Elder, engaged in the reconquest of the Danelaw, ordered to be refortified in 921 (or possibly 917).
