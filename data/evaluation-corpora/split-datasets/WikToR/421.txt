Paris is a city in Henry County, Tennessee, 86 miles (138 km) northwest of Nashville, on a fork of the West Sandy River. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 10,156. It is the county seat of Henry County. A 60-foot (18 m) replica of the Eiffel Tower stands in Paris. Paris is also home of the "World's Biggest Fish Fry". The present site of Paris was selected by five commissioners appointed to the task at the December 1822 session of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions of Henry County. Their choice was fifty acres, 37 and one half of which were owned by Joseph Blythe and 12 and one half owned by Peter Ruff, both of whom gifted the land. A public square, streets, alleys and 104 lots were laid off and the lots were sold at auction over a two-day period in either March or April 1823. Paris was incorporated on September 30, 1823. It was the first town incorporated in West Tennessee, followed by Lexington on October 9, 1824, and Memphis on December 19, 1826. The city was named after Paris, France, in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette.
