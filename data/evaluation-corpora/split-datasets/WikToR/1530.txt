Its former name used to be Panangatan, which comes from the root word sang-at, meaning "to put up on an elevated place". This referred to the practice of fishermen from Dimiao and Lila who would put up (sang-at) their boats on the banks of the Panangatan River when taking shelter during the south-west monsoons. Here nipa palms grew along the river, preventing the boats from being washed away by the waves. Panangatan remained part of Dimiao until 1867. That year a Spanish priest was assigned to the place and it became a separate municipality. The priest gave it a new name, naming after his birthplace in Spain. In 1879 Valencia had a population of 7,009.
