Fairfield is an area of Liverpool, in Merseyside, England, encompassing streets between Tuebrook and Kensington and stretching to Old Swan. It consists of a variety of houses; there are some traditional red-brick terraces, larger Victorian villas and also the notable and rather wonderful 300-year-old Georgian Fairfield Crescent which is off the equally old and wonderful Prospect Vale. Hidden gems in a conservation area which were they located in a different part of Liverpool would be worth considerably more. The area also contains the Victorian Newsham Park, for which the area is notable. Friends of Newsham Park meet with council officers regularly at the Newsham Park park forum to discuss improvements to the park and are currently anticipating the start on site of the building of a new pavilion. Fairfield is now also home to the new shopping development on Prescot Road, which brings much needed retail stores like Iceland, Tesco, Greggs and other shops into this once neglected neighbourhood centre. Another new facility is the community fire station on Beech Street which was opened in 2010 by the Duchess of Gloucester. It has been named "Kensington" Fire Station, despite being just inside the Fairfield border. Residents of Fairfield with its 300 year old history are often cross when their area is referred to as "Kensington", and will write letters of complaint to the Liverpool Echo. They are fiercely proud of their history. Fairfield is paired with Kensington to form a Liverpool City Council Ward.
