The parish of Saint James ("St. James") is an area located in the western central part of the country of Barbados. Increasingly St. James is becoming known as the playground of the rich and famous, and a haven for sun-starved tourists. In local colloquium, St. James was known as the "Gold Coast", but due to its ongoing popularity it is now referred to as the "Platinum Coast", reflective of the parishes many glitzy beach-front mansions, pristine beaches, luxury hotels and consistently high land prices. Many Barbadians say within the Platinum Coast there are billionaires such as the deceased Sathya Sai Baba and others own property somewhere within a 6-mile stretch of beach on the island. The parish also has great historic significance, as it was here that the first British settlers landed in 1625. Under the authority of King James, the British claimed Barbados upon landing in St. James' present-day city of Holetown (formerly Jamestown, named after the King himself); this settlement turned Barbados into what would later be known as "Little England".
