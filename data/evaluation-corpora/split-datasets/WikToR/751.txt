Windsor is a town in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 6,247 at the 2010 census. The town is on the south border of the county and is east of Binghamton. The town includes the village of Windsor, located on the Susquehanna River. The town of Windsor is the largest in the county. This area along the Susquehanna had long been settled by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, including those of the historic Iroquois Confederacy, who used the river for transportation, water and fishing. Around 1712 remnants of the Tuscarora tribe settled in the northern part of the town. Also an Iroquoian-speaking people, they had migrated from North Carolina, which they left because of warfare with English colonists and other tribes. In 1722, the Tuscarora were accepted by the Iroquois as the Sixth Nation of their political confederacy. Their fortified village, Onaquaga, was an outpost of the British Colonies. A mission had been established there by the Indian Superintendent, Sir William Johnson. Mohawk and other allies of the British also became established there. Joseph Brant used it as a base for his Volunteers, which fought with the British during the American Revolutionary War. In retaliation for joint British and Iroquois raids on frontier communities, the Continental Army attacked and destroyed Onaquaga in October 1778.
