Salamanca (Otomi: Xidoo "Place of Tepetate") is a city in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. Founded January 1, 1603 as 'Villa de Salamanca' by the Viceroy Gaspar de Zuniga and Acevedo, fifth Earl of Monterrey, who was originally from Salamanca (Spain). The town was founded in the lands of Bajio, after cattle ranchers and poor farmers, a few Spaniards, and small groups of Otomi Indians who formerly occupied a village named Xidoo, already lived in the area. In recent years, many refineries have opened, and Salamanca has grown rapidly to become an important site for manufacturing and service industry in the region. Also, the University of Guanajuato has made many scientific contributions to develop agricultural and industrial technologies, giving a boost to the local and regional industries. The city reported a 2010 census population of 260,759. The fourth-largest city in the state (behind Le√≥n, Irapuato, and Celaya), it is also the largest of four places called "Salamanca" in Mexico. Salamanca's cuisine is very diverse because, thanks to the oil refinery, it is a city that has people from all over the country, from cities such as Veracruz, Oaxaca and Mexico City. Each of these cities has its own variety of food, so one can find enchiladas, wheat gorditas, pambazo, hamburgers, its famous carnitas (pulled pork), arrachera, cabrito(goat), birria, barbecue, cecina, and pizza. There are food stands on virtually every street corner. Many types of locally made icepops & ice cream are also popular in the city.
