Linton is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. The population at the 2011 census was 176. It is to the immediate south, and across the River Wharfe, from Grassington, near Threshfield and eight miles north of the market town Skipton. The green of this small, picturesque village is set among a fine Vanbrugh almshouse, a pub and three stone bridges over its beck. Not far to its north-east, Linton makes a second impressive appearance, where Linton Beck runs down to the River Wharfe at the limestone Linton Falls, there bridged for walkers on a path up the Wharfe's north bank to Grassington. Amidst the group of cottages close by the Falls is a charming, 14th century, packhorse bridge, 'Little Emily's Bridge', a few minutes' walk from the church of Saint Michael and All Saints. Dating from the 12th century, Linton Church (as it is usually called) spreads an apron of churchyard, decorated with buttercups and fine gravestones, upon a small river plain bounded by a bend to its east of the Wharfe, as it flows from the Falls toward Burnsall, along the Dales Way. Except at high water, the river is crossed near the churchyard by a much-photographed, ancient course of stepping-stones, below an old (now renovated) mill house. For a convenient map of the above, further descriptions and a walking tour of the area, see the Dalesman's walking guide near Linton Falls:
