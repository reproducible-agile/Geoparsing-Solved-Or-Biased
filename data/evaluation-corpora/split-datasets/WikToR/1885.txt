Salisbury is a city in Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,618 at the 2010 census. The land where Salisbury is now located was first owned by Prior Bibo, a veteran of the War of 1812, in the late 1820s. A tract of 320 acres was granted to Bibo by the U.S. government as a bonus for his military service. Following two intermediate owners, the land was sold for $400 to Judge Lucius Salisbury in 1856. He had surveyors lay out the town plat in 1857, and the town was founded on April 1, 1867. The city has had a post office since 1863, when Judge Salisbury opened it in his home. He also ran the stagecoach stop from his business, known as "Shop-A-While." By the 1870 U.S. Census, Salisbury's population was 626. Just two years later the town was struck by a large tornado. Major fires damaged much of the business district in 1877 and again in 1882. On April 4, 1882, Salisbury was organized and chartered as a fourth-class city under Missouri laws.
