Alberton is a town in Mineral County, Montana, United States. The population was 420 at the 2010 census. It was named for Albert J. Earling, president of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Alberton was the location of a major chlorine chemical release in 1996. Alberton is the home of Northwest Indian Bible School, a Bible-training institution founded and operated by the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference.) The town celebrates its railroad heritage each year with "Alberton's Railroad Day", which is always held the third Saturday in July. https://www.facebook.com/Alberton.Railroad.Day.Montana July 18, 2015 marked the 30th anniversary of this community event.
