Ide /ˈiːd/ is a village in Devon, England situated less than a mile to the southwest of Exeter. The village church (rebuilt in 1834) is dedicated to the German Saint Ida of Herzfeld. The village is home to two pubs: the Poacher's Arms and Huntsman Inn. A long ford crosses a lane on the edge of the village. Above Ide on a hilltop at SX8888 is the site of a Roman fortlet or signal station. The majority of the village is separated from suburban Exeter by the A30 dual carriageway. Whilst it was controversial at the time of construction, the road has effectively enabled Ide to maintain an independent identity. However, the parish boundaries extend a short distance over the A30 and several notable buildings within the parish, including Ide House and the Twisted Oak pub, are located on the Exeter side. Ide Halt railway station on the G.W.R. Teign Valley Line opened in 1903 and closed to passengers on 9 June 1958. The site of the station was re-developed as St Ida's Close and no trace now remains.
