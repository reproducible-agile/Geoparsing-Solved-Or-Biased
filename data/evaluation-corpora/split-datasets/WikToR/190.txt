Esperanza is a first class municipality in the province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 63,207 people. Esperanza is politically subdivided into 19 barangays. "Esperanza" is a Spanish word meaning "hope". It is believed that the first baby born in the first settled area in the wildness of Dulawan was a baby girl whom the early settlers called Esperanza, with the anticipation that with the birth of child, the name alone could inspire the coming in of peace, unity and prosperity to the settlers. In 1952, a group of Christian settlers established a settlement in Villamor within the then municipal district of Dulawan (presently known as barangay Villamor). In 1953, motivated by the primary concern for the education of their children, the settlers petitioned the school authorities for a school at Barrio Villamor. And on the opening of that school year, the Villamor Primary School was opened. In the same year, purok leader Silverio Africa of Purok Esperanza initiated and requested a government survey for the proposed bario site of Esperanza with the expressed approval of Datu Into Saliao. The survey was officially known and identified as TSâ€“310.
