Delta, Ontario, is a community in the Township of Rideau Lakes, Leeds and Grenville County in Eastern Ontario. The village is located between two lakes, Upper Beverley and Lower Beverley, along highway 42, approximately 15 kilometers west of Athens, Ontario and 28 kilometers east of Westport, Ontario. The original name for Delta was Stevenstown, chosen for its founder, Baptist Clergyman Abel Stevens. Stevens, a British Loyalist from Vermont, New Hampshire, settled in the area in 1796, attracted by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe's offer of free land in Upper Canada. Within 2 years, Stevens had convinced about 100 families to relocate to the region. Among many of his achievements, Stevens founded the village's first mill (the predecessor to the Old Stone Mill, built by William Jones, not by Stevens as is commonly mistaken), a Baptist church in neighbouring Philipsville, and an iron-works in what is now known as Lyndhurst. Delta saw a few name changes during its early years. After the construction of the stone mill, the name of Stevenstown was changed to Stone Mills. In 1821, it was changed once more to Beverley, in honour of the Legislative Assembly member Sir John Beverley Robinson. Then, finally, in 1886, the name was changed to Delta, after an application for a town post office was rejected upon the discovery that a village already existed by the name of Beverley. 'Delta' was chosen because the shape of the two Beverley Lakes, connected by the village, resembles triangles - the shape of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, delta.
