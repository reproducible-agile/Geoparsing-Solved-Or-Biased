It also has 2 museums: the General Tommy Franks Museum and the Kiowa County Museum. The present town of Hobart began almost overnight on August 6, 1901, when lots on the former Kiowa-Apache-Comanche Reservation in southern Oklahoma Territory were put up for sale. It quickly became the residence of 2936 people, mostly living in tents. Initially, the town was nicknamed Ragtown. Wooden structures replaced tents as fast as possible. By 1903, Hobart had electric lights, an ice plant, and some large wholesale businesses. It also had a wooden courthouse. It developed into a town whose economy was based on the production of cotton. At statehood in November 1907, Hobart had a population of 2936. Hobart's population declined to 2936 in 1920, but resumed growing for several years afterward. In 1930, the population was 4982. In 1950, it reached a peak of 5380. Thereafter, the town population went into a long-term decline that has continued to the present. In the 1950 water supply in the area was improved with a series of reservoirs; the town is connected by aqueduct to Lake Hobart several kilometres to the north.
