Donggang Township (Chinese: 東港鎮; pinyin: Dōnggǎng Zhèn; Wade–Giles: Tung1-Kang3 Chen4; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tang-káng Tìn; literally: "East Port") or Tungkang Township is an urban township in west-central Pingtung County, Taiwan. Located on Taiwan's western coastline, along the Taiwan Strait, it has one of Taiwan's largest fishing harbors. Dapeng Bay with its national scenic area is just south of Donggang. The town also has East Haven Palace of Eastern Prosperity (Chinese: 東隆宮; pinyin: Dōnglóng gōng, literally Donglong Temple), which worships "Royal Lord Wen" (Chinese: 溫王爺; pinyin: Wēn wángyé. The word Wen is pronounced the same as "plague" in Chinese), and is known for its triannual ceremony of "burning king's boat" (burning plague boat). Donggang was opened as a port by the Chinese admiral Koxinga in the 17th Century. It was a major commercial port for Taiwan until the end of the 19th Century. During Japanese rule, it was placed under Takao Prefecture as Tōkō town (東港街) and served the Japanese naval facilities in Dapeng Bay.
