Verdun (/vərˈdʌn/; French: [vɛʁˈdœ̃]) is a borough (arrondissement) of the city of Montreal, Quebec, situated along the St. Lawrence River. It consists of the former city of Verdun, which was merged with the city of Montreal on January 1, 2002. Verdun did not hold a demerger referendum on June 20, 2004. The settlement of Verdun was founded in 1671, making it one of Canada's oldest cities. In 1956, Nuns' Island (île des Sœurs) was amalgamated with Verdun, which is on the Island of Montreal. The borough of Verdun is located in the southwestern part of the Island of Montreal and also includes Nuns' Island (île des Sœurs). The part on the Island of Montreal is bounded to the southwest by LaSalle, to the northwest by the borough of Le Sud-Ouest (Ville-Émard and Côte-Saint-Paul) and the Canal de l'Aqueduc, to the northeast by the Pointe-Saint-Charles (Le Sud-Ouest) and the Décarie Autoroute (Aut. 15), and to the southeast by the St. Lawrence River.
