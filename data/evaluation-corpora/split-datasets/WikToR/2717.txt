Taishan also called Toishan (Chinese: 台山; pinyin: Táishān; Jyutping: toi4 saan1; Taishanese: Hoisan [hɔ̀isān]) is a coastal county-level city in southern Guangdong province in the People's Republic of China. At the 2010 census, its population was 941,095 inhabitants even though only 394,855 were considered as urban. Taishan calls itself the "No. 1 Home of Overseas Chinese". An estimated half a million Chinese Americans are of Taishanese descent. Taishan is located in the Pearl River Delta, in the southwest of Jiangmen, to which it administratively belongs, and 140 kilometres west of Hong Kong. It contains 95 islands and islets, including the largest island in Guangdong, Shangchuan Island. Taishan is one of the Five Counties in Guangdong, previously called Sze Yup which excluded Heshan, and is now part of the Greater Taishan Region. On 12 February 1499 during the Ming dynasty, Taishan was founded as Xinning County (Chinese: 新宁县) from land in the southwest of Xinhui County. Xinning was romanized as "Sunning" during the late Qing dynasty, as well as "Sinning", "Hsinning", "Hsînnîng" and "Llin-nen".
