Aurora is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 386 at the 2000 census. In mid-summer of 1847 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed a six mile (10 km) square which approximates the current boundaries of Aurora. Then in December 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description: This Township contains a few swamps some of considerable extent they are all unfit for cultivation.
