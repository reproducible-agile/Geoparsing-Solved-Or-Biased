Charlestown (Irish: Baile Chathail) is a town in County Mayo, Ireland, contiguous with Bellaghy, County Sligo, at the crossroads of the N17 and N5. Charlestown was built in the mid-19th century on the initiative of Lord Dillon's agent, Charles Strickland, adjoining Bellaghy in County Sligo. The town now has a population of approximately 800. There are two schools in Charlestown, St. Attracta's National School and St.Joseph's Marist Convent. The village was the subject of a serialised social commentary in The Irish Times by John Healy. This was later published as Death Of An Irish Town, and later republished as No One Shouted Stop! Written in 1967, it was highly critical of government policies towards rural areas, and took Charlestown as an example solely because it was the town of the author's birth. Gaelic Football team Charlestown Sarsfields reached the All-Ireland club semi-final in 2001, losing out on a final spot by two points. In 2012 the town's sporting offering was complemented with the formation of Charlestown Boxing Club. In a relatively short time, the club has successfully acquired numerous county and provincial titles, 1 National championship title and 3 Runner's-Up. It's boxers have also been selected to represent Co. Mayo in inter-county competition.
