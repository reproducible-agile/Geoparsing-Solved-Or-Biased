Cambridge is a village in Dane (mostly) and Jefferson counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 1,457 at the 2010 census. Of this, 1,348 were in Dane County, and 109 were in Jefferson County. The Dane County portion of Cambridge is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Jefferson County portion is part of the Watertownâ€“Fort Atkinson Micropolitan Statistical Area. Cambridge settlement dates back to October 15, 1847 when farmer Joseph Keyes filed plans with the Register of Deeds of Dane County. The first structure in the area was a dam on the northern part of the Koshkonong River. By the late 1880s, Cambridge had grown into a community of about 700 people with shops, hotels, and a post office. Future inventor Ole Evenrude lived there. In 1890 a devastating fire broke out, destroying most of the businesses and parts of Main Street. The town was rebuilt by 1910, following the fire, and the invention of the automobile ignited tourism and nearby Lake Ripley became a destination for many Chicago travelers. During the 1980s-1990s, Cambridge was known as the "salt glaze pottery capital of the world" because of the potteries located there.
