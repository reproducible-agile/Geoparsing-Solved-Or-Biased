San Patricio is a city in Nueces and San Patricio counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 318 at the 2000 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, San Patricio, located at 27°57′33″N 97°46′23″W (27.959196, -97.773134), has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10.0 km²), of which 3.8 square miles (9.9 km²) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km²) (1.03%) is water. The town was founded in 1829 by empresarios James McGloin and John McMullen. They had received approval from the Mexican government to settle 200 Irish Catholic families on the land—the name meaning Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. Empresario James Power was involved as well. The Battle of San Patricio was fought near the town in 1836 during the Texas Revolution. With the approval of the General Council, Texas revolutionaries James Grant, Frank W. Johnson and Robert C. Morris collaborated on plans to lead an assault on the Mexican town of Matamoros. Recruiting some 300 men, several of who were native to San Antonio, they gathered provisions from the Alamo and Presidio La Bahia for their expedition. The men needed mounts for their long journey and divided into groups as they traveled toward the coast to capture wild horses.
