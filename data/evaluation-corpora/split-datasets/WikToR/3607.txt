Huntington is a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 2,180 at the time of the 2010 census. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. Originally Plantation Number 9. by the Court of Massachusetts Bay, Huntington has a colorful history, hinted at by the town's incorporation date of March 5th, 1855, decades later than the towns around it. The town was assembled from pieces of surrounding towns, which were grafted onto the town of Norwich, Murrayfield, and Knightville . The present village center sits on what was the meeting point of three towns and two counties. The location of the village created a tangle of jurisdictional confusion. With the coming of the railroad in the 1840s and the expansion of industry and population that came with it, the political difficulties that the boundaries presented became untenable. The solution that resulted in the town we call home today was crafted by a Northampton attorney named Charles Huntington. Once the new town was incorporated, Mr. Huntington presented it with a gift that was the foundation of the town's library. After some discussion, the newly formed town voted to adopt the of name of 'Huntington', in honor of its recent architect and benefactor.
