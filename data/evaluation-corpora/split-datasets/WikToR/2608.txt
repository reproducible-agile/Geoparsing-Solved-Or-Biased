Abak became the seat of Government in 1902 after conquest by war against the British colonial invaders at the valley lying between Ediene and Abak Clans. The outcome of that conquest was the penetration into the hinterland by the colonial soldiers and eventual installation of the government. Valley in the local language is called “Aba-ag” and fighting is “Anwan.” By joining the two words “Aba- ag” and “Anwan” the names “Aba-ag Ikot Anwan” was given to the newly established entity. The seat of Government kept growing until 1957 and 1958 when it gained the status of Divisional Council Headquarters. At the establishment, the area included the present Ukanafun, Oruk Anam, Etim Ekpo, Ika and the present Abak. All the places mentioned here have been developed to become full-fledged local government areas.
