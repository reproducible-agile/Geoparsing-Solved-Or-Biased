Hun or Houn /ˈhuːn/ (Arabic: هون‎ Hūn) is an oasis town in the northern Fezzan region of southwest Libya. The town is the capital of the Jufra District. Hun is about halfway between Sabha and the Mediterranean coast in the Sahara Desert. The modern city of Hun is 150 years old. The natural landscape around Hun mainly consists of black basalt mountains, with extensive sand dunes, and date palm trees - Phoenix dactylifera groves indicating oases. The cities of Waddan and Sokna are the nearest settlements. There is a ruined ksar and several mosques in the city of Waddan. All three towns are oases characterized by the abundance of natural springs and date palm trees. There are public buses to the cities of Sirte and Sabha. There is also a military airport located between Hun and Waddan, Al Jufra Air Base. Hun is 240 km south of Sirte, 370 km from Misrata and 272 km north of Sabha. Hun has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, warm winters as well as very little rainfall throughout the year. In this part of the desert, summer daytime temperatures are a bit moderated due to the influence of the cooler offshore winds from the Mediterranean Sea, although averages high temperatures consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest months of the year. Hun is said to bake in bright sunshine during 85 % of the daylight hours. Hun is located in one of the sunniest and driest regions in the world.
