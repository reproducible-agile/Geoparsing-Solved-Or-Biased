Hamilton is an inner northern suburb of the City of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, lying on the north bank of the Brisbane River along Hamilton Reach. The area is hilly with views of the Brisbane central business district. At the 2011 Australian census the suburb recorded a population of 4,721. In 2013, the suburb had the highest mean taxable income of any in Queensland. It is believed the first hotel in the district was built by the Gustavus Hamilton (father of Messrs. F. G. Hamilton, barrister, and R. Hamilton, surveyor). Amongst the earlier lessees of the hotel was a Mrs. Warren, who, by coincidence, married another Mr. Hamilton, so that the hotel was occupied by different families of the name Hamilton. The Hamilton Hotel became an easy reference mark in the days when buildings were few in the district, and its name was gradually applied to the whole district. In Brisbane's early history, Hamilton was the home to many aristocrats and clergy. This suburb is known for being an "old wealth" suburb compared to "new wealth" suburbs in Brisbane such as Paddington, Toowong and Indooroopilly. Many of Brisbane's iconic mansions are found in Hamilton, mainly because the exclusive suburb boasts spectacular views of the entire central business district and other surrounding suburbs.
