Buenavista is a third-class municipality in the province of Quezon, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 29,053 people. It used to be called Piris. Buenavista is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. Piris was its former name. It was a mere hamlet of the municipality of Guinanyagan, province of Quezon and remained as such for quite a number of years until it finally became a municipality. Buenavista is now its official name which means beautiful view. Its original name was Piri as engraved in the oldest church bell which was donated by one Don Jose Casal in the year 1866. It used to be located in the Sitio of Pinagbayanan situated in the western side of the Piris River which is about one a half kilometers away from the present town site. This place became the choice of the founders who were a mixture of Bicolanos and Visayans to enable them to easily escape the Moro raids that were prevalent during the olden times. When the raids finally subsided, the barrio of Piris was transferred to its present location. The word Piri was changed to Piris and later re-changed to Piris.
