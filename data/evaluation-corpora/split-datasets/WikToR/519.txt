Pali is a city in Rajasthan state of western India. Located in the duthariya region, Pali is the administrative headquarters of Pali District and comes in the marwar region. It is situated on the bank of the river Bandi and is 70 km south east of Jodhpur. It is known as "The Industrial City". Pali (formerly known as Pallika and Palli) was a trade centre. In the 11th century AD, Pali was ruled by the Guhilas of Mewar. In the 12th century it became a part of the Nadol kingdom and was ruled by the Chauhan clan. In 1153 AD it was ruled by solanki or Chalukya Kumarpal and his feudatory Vahadadeva. Then it came under possession of Songara Chauhans of Jalore. The Rathor dynsasty chronicles relate that Siyaji or Sheoji, grandson of Jai Chandra, the last Gahadvala Rathore king of Kannauj, came to Marwar on a pilgrimage to Dwarka in Gujarat, and on halting at the town of Pali he and his followers settled there to protect the Brahmin community from the raids of marauding bands. His devali with the inscription of 1273 AD was discovered 21 km north west of Pali. Champavatas Rathores ruled Pali until 1761 AD when it became part of Jodhpur state.
