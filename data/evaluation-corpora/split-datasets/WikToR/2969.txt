According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 106,649. In the 2013 election, it had 62,960 registered voters. Consolacion comprises 21 barangays distributed over its 37 km2 (14.3 sq mi): Consolacion was a component barangay first founded in 1871 with a population of 14,248. Before this, it was only a barrio of the municipality of Mandaue. Consolacion became a separate town in 1871. However, in 1902 and 1903, unable to maintain its status as an independent municipality, it reverted to Mandaue. In 1920, Consolacion was again made an independent municipality after a petition was accepted by the governor. So grateful were the townspeople to the Spanish governor that they named their new town after his daughter – Consolacion – and they also chose San Narciso as their patron saint, the namesake of the governor's wife, Narcisa.
