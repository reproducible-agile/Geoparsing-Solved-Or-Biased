Woodville is bound by Cheltenham Parade to the west, Torrens Road to the north, Port Road to the south and Park Street to the east, excluding the area of Cheltenham Park Racecourse. Woodville was one of the first areas to be settled by European migrants in the mid-19th century, many establishing dairy farms in the vicinity. By 1853 Woodville consisted of 24 houses, a forge and a wheelwrightâ€™s shop. The Woodville Post Office opened around March 1856. It has many fine examples of colonial and federation architecture and was considered to be a genteel area. Many European migrants settled in Woodville and the surrounds after World War II. It was a busy local centre in the 1950s and 1960s when General Motors Holden had a car manufacturing plant in the nearby suburb of Cheltenham and because of its proximity to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woodville South. Woodville Road was the hub of local activity with numerous commercial businesses. During the 1980s and 1990s, Woodville and its surrounds became home to many Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War. Decline set in in the 1980s upon the closure of the Cheltenham plant of General Motors Holden. Woodville became a depressed suburb, particularly during the 1990s. Since then, Woodville is undergoing a revival and many are now seeking residence in Woodville because of its architecture. Woodville Road, although not as a lively as it once was, is starting to develop a personality again. Woodville's inhabitants are still multiethnic.
