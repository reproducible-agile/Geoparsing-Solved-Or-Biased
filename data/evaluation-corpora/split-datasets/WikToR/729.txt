Dalton is a village in Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 17 at the 2010 census. Dalton is located at 39°23′50″N 92°59′28″W (39.397130, -92.991248). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.18 square miles (0.47 km2), all of it land. Lewis and Clark made camp at what would later be known as the Cut-Off on June 12, 1804, and it was here that the expedition met with Pierre Dorion, a man who had reportedly been with the Sioux for 20 years and was thought to have some influence upon them. The Lewis and Clark journal entry describes the Dalton Cut-Off as connected to the Missouri River by a creek. More than sixty years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the area—after the end of the Civil War—the village of Dalton was born when the railroad created a need for it. The village was named for William Dalton who had donated the 40 acres (160,000 m2) and a railroad depot was built for the St. Louis & Pacific line. [note: William Dalton was believed to be the grandfather of Missouri's sitting governor at the time the village was named, but the contributor has not yet found sources to support that claim.]
