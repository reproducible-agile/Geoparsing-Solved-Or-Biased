Hastings is an amalgamated village within the municipality of Trent Hills, Northumberland County, in the province of Ontario, Canada. It is on the Trent River in what is considered to be Ontario's "cottage country". Hastings had a population of 1,208 at the 2001 Census. It is known as "The Hub of the Trent" as Hastings is directly on the Trent River and serves as a major centre for tourists, boaters, and fishermen. One of Hastings' notable symbols is a tall, blue water tower which is perched prominently on high ground in the northern portion of the community. Hastings is now part of the municipality of Trent Hills and makes up the second most substantial population centre in the municipality. The current mayor of Trent Hills is Hector Macmillan. Macmillan was first elected at the 2003 municipal election and on October 27, 2014, was re-elected for a fourth term. A marina was built in Hastings which added to the already bustling waterfront. In continuation of the street-scape design theme from the new Hastings Village Marina a Hastings Waterfront & Downtown Improvement Plan was prepared in early 2009. In 2009, after a four-year break, the local Chamber of Commerce was revived.
