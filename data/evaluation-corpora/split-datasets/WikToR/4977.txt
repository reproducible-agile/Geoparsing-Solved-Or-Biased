Hempstead is one of the three towns in Nassau County, New York, United States, occupying the southwest part of the county. Twenty-two incorporated villages are completely or partially in the town. Hempstead's combined population was 759,757 at the 2010 Census, the majority of the population of the county and by far the most of any town in New York. Also, a village named Hempstead is within the Town. If the town were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest city in New York behind New York City and ahead of Buffalo. It would be the 16th-largest city in the country, between Columbus, Ohio and Fort Worth, Texas. The town's population density is greater than that of Columbus and Fort Worth. Part of Hofstra University's north campus is located in Hempstead. The town was first settled around 1644 following the establishment of a treaty between English colonists, John Carman and Robert Fordham, and the Lenape Indians in 1643. Although the settlers were from the English colony of Connecticut, a patent was issued by New Amsterdam after the settlers had purchased land from the local natives. This transaction is depicted in a mural in the Hempstead Village Hall, reproduced from a poster commemorating the 300th anniversary of Hempstead Village.
