Lodi (also called Fullerton, Gilderoy or Waterman) is an unincorporated community in Liberty Township, Parke County, Indiana, United States. Set on State Hwy 234, the most prominent feature is Waterman Baptist Church, which occupies a red brick building in the north-east corner of town. Just south of the town is one of the first round barns, the W. H. York Round Barn, which was built in 1895. Less than a year later though the town would change its name to Lodi on January 26, 1837. It may have been named for the city of Lodi, Italy near Milan, Italy, where Napoleon won a great victory over the Austrians in 1796. The Post Office was officially call Lodiville. Once again the town's name changed in 1857 to Waterman in honor of Dr. Waterman who had opened a pork packing plant and store in town. In 1874 an R.M. Waterman owned large coal fields north of town. The Wabash and Erie Canal passed around Lodi on the west side and wrapped around the south side before crossing Coal Creek and continuing its journey south. A feeder dam was built on coal creek. The last canal boat to pass Lodi was in 1875 heading north to Lafayette.
