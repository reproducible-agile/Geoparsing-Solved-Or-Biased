Altamira is a town in the Puerto Plata province of the Dominican Republic. The town's name is the subject of at least two different origin traditions. One asserts that when Christopher Columbus first arrived in the area, he took note of the height of the mountains and exclaimed: "Look at the heights." Another reports that the name is based on the geographical resemblance of the region to Spain's Altamira Caves. On October 29, 1889, President Ulises Heureaux declared the town a municipality. To this day, October 29th is celebrated in Altamira with municipal festivities. In its earliest days, Altamira functioned as a set of large agricultural ranches, populated by families transferred there from nearby conucos (small farms). For this reason, some still call Altamira's signature tobacco plantations the "Ranches of Puerto Plata." At the time of the Devastations of Ozoria, the community helped maintain communication between the Valley of the Cibao and Port Silver. It also served as a refuge and hideout for settlers who refused to abandon the region. During the period of the Annexation, Altamira became a part of the Province of Santiago by Law No. 40 of 1845. After the War of Restoration brought national independence, Altamira's importance grew, as not just an area of strategic military importance, but also as a demographic and commercial center.
