William Buford donated land for the establishment of a town around the site of Maj. Andrew Wallace's settlement at Wallace Crossroads. The surveying and platting was completed over the next year by Joseph Bledsoe Jr and the community was named Lancaster for the Pennsylvania town, either because one of its settlers came from there or because the town was designed on a similar plan. The post office was established in 1801 and operated under the name Lancaster Court House until 1811. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1837.
