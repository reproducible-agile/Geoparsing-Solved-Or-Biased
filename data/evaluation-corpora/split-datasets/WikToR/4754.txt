Lila is a fifth income class municipality in the province of Bohol, Philippines. Twenty kilometres (12 mi) from Tagbilaran, it is bounded to the east by Dimiao, to the west by Loay and to the north by Loboc. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 11,985. Lila comprises 18 barangays, of which 10 are coastal and 8 inland: In 1869, during the Spanish Regime, a place called “Tinubdan” was discovered by the Spaniards. Passing a pool fed by a spring, their attention was caught by the water lilies whose flowers were of lilac, a unique shade of the color violet. And thus the place was referred to as Lilac which later evolved into Lila. The coastal town of Lila once belonged to the Municipality of Dimiao. It was composed of the barrios of the municipalities of Loay and Dimiao. In 1899, during the Spanish–American War, the municipal building, the church and neighboring houses were razed to the ground and burned. Thus, no records can be shown stating when Lila was annexed to the town of Dimiao. However, the Agustinian mission in Bohol has written that Lila was a separate municipality in 1879, with a population of 4,023.
