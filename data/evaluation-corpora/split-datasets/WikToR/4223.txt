Winton is a suburb of Bournemouth in Dorset, England. It lies approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Bournemouth town centre, along Wimborne Road (the A347). The name Winton derives from Wintoun Castle in Scotland, which was home to the Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, a relative of the Talbot family: landowners who started the development of Winton. At the beginning of the 19th century the area was just rough heathland, with just a track linking ancient Moordown Village to Horseshoe Common. In 1805 this all changed when a new main road through Winton was put in and named Muscliff Road (today it is known as Wimborne Road). Around 1850 wealthy Scottish philanthropists Georgina and Marianne Talbot saw the plight of local workers and set about trying to improve their lives by purchasing land along the road and building four artisan cottages and sinking wells to provide fresh water. By 1891 the population of Winton had reached 4,000 and by 1894 the needs of Winton were so great that they were put under the care of the Winton Parish Council and later in 1897 Winton Urban District Council was formed. In 1901 Bournemouth (which was by then a county borough) increased its boundaries to include Winton and other districts.
