According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 110,570 people. Candelaria is the second largest industrial center of the province, after Lucena City. Among the municipalities in Quezon Province, Candelaria has the most desiccated coconut factories and oil refineries, such as Peter Paul Philippine Corporation, Primex Coco Products Inc., Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation, and others, which employ thousands of people. Prior to 1885, the pioneering barangays of Candelaria in its Western part notably, Taguan, Kinatihan and Masin were parts of the Municipality of Tiaong, while Malabanban, Mangilag and Sta. Catalina in the East, were under the jurisdiction of the town of Sariaya. It was on December 26, 1878, that a permit was granted by the Governor General of the Philippine Islands for the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. Its boundaries were fixed by means of a treaty signed by the notable leaders of Tiaong, Sariaya and the founding families of Candelaria.
