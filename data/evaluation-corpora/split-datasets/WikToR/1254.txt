Pilar is a third class municipality in the province of Capiz, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 41,572 people. Pilar is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. The coastal town sprang out from an Austronesian settlement in the early 16th century when indio natives managed to escape oppression from Spanish colonial authorities. The settlement was then known as Sibala, named after the river that ran through the coastal village. In 1570, however, the settlement was seized by Spanish forces and the guardia civil took full control of the village fortifying it with a military garrison. It later flourished into a bigger town and was renamed after its designated patron La Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar). In the 18th century, it adopted the (Holy Trinity) La Santisima Trinidad as its municipal patron after a wooden image of the Holy Trinity from the wreckage of a Spanish galleon ship en route from Mexico was found in the town's coastline. Augustinian friars were initially assigned to preach in the town since then until it would later receive its permanent parish priest and Roman Catholic Church.
