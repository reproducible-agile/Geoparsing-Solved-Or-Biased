The Gulf Developmental Road passes through the town, linking Cairns - 380 kilometres (240 mi) to the east - and Normanton - 301 kilometres (187 mi) to the west. Georgetown is the administrative headquarters of the Shire of Etheridge, a local government area encompassing the nearby settlements of Mount Surprise, Forsayth and Einasleigh.

Originally known by the name Etheridge, the town's name was changed in 1871 to honour an early gold commissioner, Howard St George. Georgetown Post Office opened on 15 January 1872. By 1900 grazing had replaced gold mining as the region's primary source of income. Georgetown is one of the real locations mentioned several times in the novel "A Town Like Alice" by Nevil Shute.
