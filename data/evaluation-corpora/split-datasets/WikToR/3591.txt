Until the twentieth century, Goshen was an island in a marsh at the edge of Tulare Lake, formerly the largest freshwater lake west of the Great Lakes until drained. In 1858, the Butterfield Overland Mail passed through the area stopping at Head of Cross Creek Station, 4 miles northwest of Goshen, at the head of the place where Cross Creek divided into two branches for a time, making it easier to cross them separately. It was 12 miles west of the next stop at Visalia, and 15 miles southeast of the next stop in the other direction, Whitmore's Ferry. In the early 1890s, Chris Evans and John Sontag robbed a Southern Pacific Railroad train at Goshen. Goshen is located at 36°20′51″N 119°25′12″W (36.347447, -119.420015).
