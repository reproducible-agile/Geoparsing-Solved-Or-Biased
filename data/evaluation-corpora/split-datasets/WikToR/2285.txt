Grant County (county code GT) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2010 census, the county population was 7,829. Its county seat and only city is Ulysses. In 1873, the part of Kansas west of Range 25 was divided into 25 new counties. The new counties were Decatur, Rawlins, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Thomas, Sherman, Lane, Buffalo, Foote, Meade, Scott, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Seward, Wichita, Kearny, Greeley, Hamilton, Stanton, Kansas, Stevens, and Grant. Grant County, Kansas was named after Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States (1869â€“1877), and incumbent president at the time of the county's formation. The initial survey establishing county boundaries was in the summer of 1874. In 1883, Kearny, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Kansas, Stevens, Meade, Clark and Grant counties disappeared. Hamilton, Ford, Seward, and Hodgeman counties enlarged and Finney County was created. Grant County was split with the western portion becoming a part of Hamilton County and the eastern portion becoming a part of the newly created Finney County.
