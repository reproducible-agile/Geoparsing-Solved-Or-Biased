Lexington is a city in Henderson County, Tennessee, United States. Lexington is midway between Memphis and Nashville, lying ten miles (16 km) south of Interstate 40, which connects the two cities. The population was 7,473 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Henderson County. Shortly after the 1821 creation of Henderson County, a site near its center was chosen as a site for a county seat, and was named Lexington in honor of Lexington, Massachusetts, site of the first battle of the American Revolution. The first county courthouse was built in 1823; Lexington was incorporated in 1824 and by 1830 had a population of 260. As the lead-up to the American Civil War began, Henderson County voted against secession. As the war progressed, both Union and Confederate regiments were recruited in the county. The area in and around Lexington was the site of a skirmish on December 18, 1862. Union Colonel Robert Ingersoll sent his troops to destroy a bridge over the Beech Creek to disallow Confederate army to move into the area. However, Ingersoll's troops did not destroy the bridge and General Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops headed into Lexington. Forrest's troops overtook the Union soldiers, taking over 140 men, including Colonel Ingersoll, and collected artillery and supplies left behind by Union soldiers who escaped.
