Dora is an unincorporated community in northeastern Ozark County, Missouri. A school, post office, a couple of businesses, five churches and several homes are located there. The Dora Reorganized (R-3) School District provides an education for approximately 360 students in grades 1-12. The Dora Falcons basketball team competes with other single-A schools in Ozark, Douglas, Wright and Howell counties of SW Missouri. Dora is located at the junction of Route 181 and Highway CC about thirty miles northeast of Gainesville. On June 10, 1875, James K.P. Dobbs received a deed from the United States government to the 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land he had homesteaded. That was the beginnings of the town of Dora. On December 7, 1875, Dobbs and his wife, Margaret, sold this 40 acres (160,000 m2) to Nellie Maupin. On May 17, 1878, Nellie Maupin and James P. Maupin sold the 40 acres (160,000 m2) to Anton Fisher. Fisher built the first store in Dora, acquired the post office and named it Dora after his daughter. He built a two-story dwelling and joined it to the log house already there. He operated the store until his death.
