The Municipality of Rosario (also referred to as Salinas) is a first class urban municipality in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 92,253 people in an area of 5.6 square kilometers, making it the most densely populated city/municipality in Cavite at 16,473 per km2.

On October 22, 1845, Spanish Governor General Narciso Claveria promulgated a Decree for the establishment of a new town comprising Salinas-Leiton and Tierra Alta of San Francisco de Malabon, what is now the town of Gen. Trias. On October 27, Don Juan Arlegui, Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Manila informed the Politico-Military Governor of Cavite Don Miguel Roca, that he was designated by the Governor-General to look for a person of unquestionable integrity who will be entrusted with the money for the construction of the church building. On November 3, 1845, presbyter Don Mamerto Ner, who was at that time one of the priests of the Curia of Manila, was appointed parish priest and served until December 1866.
