Maji (also Machi) is a town in southern Ethiopia. It is located on the Boma Plateau, lying in the Bench Maji Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region, and has a longitude and latitude of 6°12′N 35°35′E with an elevation variously given as 2104, 2258 and 2430 meters above sea level. The town is the administrative center for the Maji woreda. Postal service in Maji started at some time between 1923-1932. From the 1930s the town had a customs post and a telephone station. The town is served by Tume Airport (ICAO code HAMJ). Maji was founded around 1897 when Ras Welde Giyorgis stationed a garrison of Ethiopian soldiers near the lands of the ture, a personage Garretson describes as "the most powerful and respected religious figure in the area." Garretson explains how an administrative center for the region soon followed: "Built on a commanding hill were a fortified encampment of gibbi (the personal headquarters of the governor), a church and a market. All were carefully observed and guarded by the governor and his retinue of soldiers." Richard Pankhurst records that its governor, Dejazmach Taye, amazed by the growing trade at Gambela to the west of him, during the 1920s attempted to develop exports of coffee, rubber, hides and ivory through the port town.
