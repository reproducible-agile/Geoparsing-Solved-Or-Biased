The village of Ayr, Ontario, Canada is a settlement located within the Township of North Dumfries in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Southwestern Ontario. Ayr is located south of Kitchener and west of Cambridge. In 1824, Abel Mudge (son of Elijah Mudge Sr) constructed a sawmill and flour mill at the junction of Cedar Creek and the Nith River (building at 14 Northumberland St., Ayr, Ontario). This was the first of three distinct settlements, Jedburgh in the east (Main St.), Nithvale in the west (Piper St.) and Mudge's Mill in the centre (Stanley/Northumberland Streets) in what is today the Village of Ayr. Jedburgh began in 1832 when John Hall, a young immigrant from Jedburgh, Scotland, purchased a 75-acre (300,000 m2) parcel of land that included the area now flooded by Jedburgh Dam. By 1850 Hall had developed several industries, including a flour mill, sawmill and distillery with water power provided by the damming of Cedar Creek. At the same time a smaller settlement, Nithvale, was founded to the west of Mudge's Mill where a small sawmill opened along the Nith River, its claim on history being that in 1837 it was a meeting and drilling place for MacKenzie's followers just prior to the Upper Canada Rebellion.
