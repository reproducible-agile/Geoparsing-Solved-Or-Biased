Bethany is an unincorporated village in the Canadian province of Ontario, within the single-tier municipality of Kawartha Lakes. Bethany is centred on Highway 7A. It is located a few kilometers west of Peterborough, the largest city in the area. It is a gateway community, in that it services the local winter sport ski hill Devil's Elbow just a few kilometers north of the village. Since 2000 there has been significant real-estate development, mostly in the form of individual dwellings. To the north are downhill and cross-country ski areas, mostly accessible by paved county roads. By 1869, Bethany was a village with a population of 300 in the Township of Manvers, then part of Durham County. It was a station of the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway. Since a stream passing through the village afforded power for machinery, it was a good position for a foundry, agricultural implement works and a tannery. The average cost of improved lands was $35 per acre while wild lands were valued at $23. Bethany Public Library is part of the City of Kawartha Lakes Public Library System, which offers computer access as well as ongoing free programs. The library is in the same building as the municipal offices.
