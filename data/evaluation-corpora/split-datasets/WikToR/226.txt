Hamilton is the capital of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda. It is the territory's financial centre and a major port and tourist destination. Its population of 1,010 (2010) is one of the smallest of any capital city. The history of Hamilton as a British city began in 1790 when the Bermuda Government set aside 145 acres (59 ha) for its future seat, and was officially incorporated in 1793 by an Act of Parliament and named for Governor Henry Hamilton. The Colony's capital relocated to Hamilton from St. George's in 1815. The City has been at the political and military heart of Bermuda ever since. Government buildings include the parliament, Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the Royal Navy to the west (both in Pembroke), and the British Army garrison headquarters at Prospect Camp to its east. The Town of Hamilton became a City in 1897, ahead of the consecration in 1911 of the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity (Church Of England), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, St. Theresa's, was later constructed. Today, the city overlooking Hamilton Harbour is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The City of Hamilton has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the Cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as 10 stories in this area. Bermuda's local newspaper, The Royal Gazette, reports "If you don't recognise the city, from 15 years ago, we don't blame you as it has changed so much".
