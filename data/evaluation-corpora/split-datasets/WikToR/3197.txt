Madison is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,502 at the 2010 census. Madison includes the village of Silver Lake. This area was one of the first to have land grants set aside for soldiers who had survived the French and Indian War. The land covered by these grants, parts of Eaton and Albany, was incorporated in 1852 as "Madison," in honor of President James Madison, who was born 100 years earlier. The town is home to the Madison Boulder (43°55′52″N 71°10′04″W), the largest known glacial erratic in New England, and among the largest in the world. Madison Boulder is a huge granite rock measuring 83 feet (25 m) in length, 23 feet (7.0 m) in height above the ground, and 37 feet (11 m) in width. It weighs upwards of 5,000 tons. A part of this roughly rectangular block is buried, probably to a depth of ten to twelve feet. It is located at a state park in the northwest part of town.
