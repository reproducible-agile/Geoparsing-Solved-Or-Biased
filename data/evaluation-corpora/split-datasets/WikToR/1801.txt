Holbrook (Navajo: TÊ¼iisyaakin) is a city in Navajo County, Arizona, United States. According to the 2010 census, the population of the city was 5,053. The city is the county seat of Navajo County. Holbrook was founded in 1881 or 1882, when the railroad was built, and named to honor the first chief engineer of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Early Settlements and Exploration The Holbrook area was inhabited first by the Anasazi, then Puebloans, then the Navajos and Apaches. In 1540 (some seventy years before Jamestown or the Pilgrims) Coronado searched for the Seven Cities of Cibola and camped some sixty miles east of Holbrook. Coronado sent an expedition west to find the Colorado River, and they crossed the Little Colorado some twenty-five miles east of Holbrook and found a wonderland of colors they named "El Desierto Pintada" - The Painted Desert. The expedition was then lead by the Hopis to the Grand Canyon. U.S. Settlements After the Mexican-American War ended in 1848 the area was ceded to the Untied States. In 1851 to 1857 the U.S. Army sent three expeditions along the 35th parallel, the third lead by Lt. Beale who created a ten foot wide wagon road. The area was known as Navajo Springs for a spring a dozen miles NE of Holbrook. Soon after a store and saloon was established at the confluence of the Rio Puerco and Little Colorado Rivers two miles east of Holbrook, and the area became known as Horsehead Crossing.
