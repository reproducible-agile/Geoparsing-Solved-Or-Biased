San Carlos is an upper-middle-class neighborhood in the eastern area of San Diego, California. It borders the neighborhoods of Del Cerro, Tierrasanta, and Allied Gardens, the city of La Mesa, and Mission Trails Regional Park. The "jewel" of San Carlos is Cowles Mountain. San Carlos is geographically defined largely by its proximity to Mission Trails Regional Park and to the man-made reservoir Lake Murray. The area consists primarily of single-family homes. San Carlos is in the 7th City Council District and is represented by Councilmember Scott Sherman. The neighborhood is served by the San Diego Unified School District. It contains Daillard Elementary School, Gage Elementary School, Green Elementary School, Benchley/Weinberger Elementary School, Lewis Middle School, Pershing Middle School, and Patrick Henry High School, which serves all three neighboring communities of San Carlos, Allied Gardens, and Del Cerro. The neighborhood suffered a highly publicized crime in 1979 when there was a shooting at Grover Cleveland Elementary School (since closed). The principal and a custodian were killed, and eight students and a police officer were injured. A 16-year-old girl who lived across the street was convicted of the murders. The incident inspired the Boomtown Rats song "I Don't Like Mondays".
