Burlington is the home of the Old Fashioned Apple Harvest Festival (started in 1973), which has grown into the biggest celebration of its kind in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. It is held annually on the first weekend of October. Burlington is situated along the old Northwestern Turnpike (US 50) in southeastern Mineral County, West Virginia. German and English settlers began to populate the area of Burlington in the second quarter of the 18th century following the surveying of Patterson Creek Manor by Thomas, Lord Fairfax in 1738. The village took shape around the turn of the 19th century as several mills constructed along Mill Creek and Patterson Creek brought commerce to the region. The Burlington Post Office was established on September 24, 1827. (It was closed from 1844-1853 and from 1860-1867). The construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Burlington in 1831 helped to further its development into a regional center for commerce. Many of the houses admired for their architecture in the village today were constructed in the first half of the 19th century during this time of economic prosperity. One of the oldest houses in Burlington, the Homestead, was built as a tavern to service the stage coach traffic which came through the village along the turnpike. Constructed by John and Ruth Ann Vandiver, the Homestead continued to serve as an inn and restaurant well into the mid-twentieth century.
