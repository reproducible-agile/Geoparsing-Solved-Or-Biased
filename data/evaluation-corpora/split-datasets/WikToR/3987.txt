The “long rains” fall from March through May with a single-month peak of 500 mm or more in April. Sagana is situated at the edge of a large plain at the southern foot of Mt. Kenya. Soils were formed on volcanic rocks from Mt. Kenya — latest Pliocene to Pleistocene basalts, phonolites, and pyroclastics. In areas with free drainage conditions on moderate to steep slopes, lateritic and red to reddishbrown soils are present. some areas with black cotton soils indicate that the soils have formed under restricted drainage conditions, which are the result of low rainfall and the presence of level to moderate slopes.
