Marietta is a city in and county seat of Love County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,626 at the 2010 census, a 7.4 percent increase from 2,445 at the 2000 census. Marietta is part of the Ardmore, Oklahoma Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is also a part of the Texoma region. Settlers were attracted by the fertile land near the Red River, which was conducive to agriculture and cattle raising. Cotton quickly became the principal crop. William "Bill" Washington had the largest cattle ranch in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory. Bill's brother, Jerry Washington, who lived about a mile north of present-day Marietta, became the town's first postmaster when the post office opened on December 20, 1887. A local story claims that the town was named for Jerry's wife. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (later the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) laid its rail line in early 1887, stimulating economic growth for the future town of Marietta, Indian Territory. The first train ran July 28, 1887.
