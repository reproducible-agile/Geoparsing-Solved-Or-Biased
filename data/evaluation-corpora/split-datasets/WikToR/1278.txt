Avondale is a suburb of Christchurch in the South Island of New Zealand. It is located 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) northeast of the city center, and is close to the Avon River, four kilometers to the northwest of its estuary. The suburb is centered on Avondale Road and so named due to its proximity to the Avon River. Chisnallwood Intermediate is the main Intermediate school in the eastern suburbs, and is located in Avondale. During the 2010â€“2011 Christchurch earthquakes, Avondale was hit hard by damage to land and buildings due to soil liquefaction, part of Avondale was declared by the government as residential red zone. This meant that the government considers rebuilding the infrastructure in such zone uneconomic, and the residents' properties were purchased by the government under a voluntary but coercive scheme. Ironically, the government's red zone declaration was ruled as unlawful by the High Court in August, 2013. Many roads remain damaged in Avondale as of 2014, posing a problem for residents, and the Avon river's banks had to be built up in the suburb to avoid flooding. Portaloos were present on some streets due to destroyed sewers. Building, sewer and road reparations are currently underway in the suburb.
