Lodi is a village in Medina County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,746 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1811, Lodi is the oldest settlement in Medina County. It was originally called Harrisville, in honor of Judge Joseph Harris. The community's name echoes that of the city of Lodi in northern Italy, where Napoleon won a victory in 1796. The year of incorporation was 1891. An early pioneer named Redfield (after whom Redfield Street is named) sculpted the modern route to Medina through trees. It was later deemed too curvy, so the first governmental road through the region was straightened. In later years, this road became U.S. Route 42. Lodi hosts the annual Sweet Corn Festival in the middle of July. This three-day-long event begins with a large parade through the town square. Other attractions include fair food, amusement rides, and a popular tug-of-war. Lodi is located at 41°1′59″N 82°0′42″W (41.033059, -82.011774), along the East Fork of the Black River.
