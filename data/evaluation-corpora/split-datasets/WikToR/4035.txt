Brooklyn is a town to the north of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 51 kilometres from the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. Despite sharing the name, this small New South Wales town has no relation to the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. Brooklyn is sometimes considered the northernmost suburb of the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, as it is located on the Sydney side of the Hawkesbury River, and Mooney Mooney Bridge. It is part of The County of Cumberland, in which Sydney city is located, but Brooklyn is rarely considered part of the city. Brooklyn occupies a narrow strip of tidal waterfront land aligned east â€“ west along the southern bank of the Hawkesbury River. Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park borders the suburb to the south and the F3 Sydney-Newcastle Freeway crosses the river just to the west. Long Island runs parallel with the suburb on the opposite side of Sandbrook Inlet and is joined to Brooklyn by the railway causeway. Dangar Island is sited to the north east. The general area was known as Peat's Ferry crossing for a long time until January 1884 when a plan of survey for the subdivision of land owned by Peter and William Fagan was registered with the suburb name of Brooklyn. A hotel of the same name followed later in the year. The town owes its existence and location to the main northern railway line with the railway arriving in Brooklyn in 1887 when the single track section north from Hornsby was completed.
