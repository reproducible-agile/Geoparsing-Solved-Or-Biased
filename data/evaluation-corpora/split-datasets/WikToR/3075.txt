Spring Valley is an unincorporated town and census-designated place and part of Las Vegas Township in Clark County, Nevada, United States, located 2 miles (3 km) west of the Las Vegas Strip. The population was 178,395 at the 2010 census. Spring Valley was formed in May, 1981. After purchasing the land occupied by Stardust International Raceway, Pardee Homes began developing a master-planned housing community called Spring Valley southwest of Las Vegas in the mid-1970s. By 1981, residents grouped together to solicit the Clark County Commission to create an unincorporated town, which it did that May. The town originally encompassed 1 square mile (3 km2), but now occupies much of the southwest quarter of the Las Vegas Valley, totaling 33.4 square miles (90 km2). The predominant boundaries of Spring Valley are Sahara Avenue on the north, Decatur Boulevard on the east, Warm Springs Road on the south, and Hualapai Way on the west. The area mostly consists of housing subdivisions, with strip malls lining the large boulevards that connect suburban Las Vegas to the Strip. The northern part of Spring Valley includes areas of rural-estate zoning, with large parcels of land on blocks of 1⁄64 square mile (40,000 m2). The southern part of Spring Valley is quickly developing – fifteen years ago, very little south of Tropicana Avenue was developed within Spring Valley.
