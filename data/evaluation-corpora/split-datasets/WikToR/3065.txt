The first Paleo-indians reached the central Florida area near the end of the last ice age, as they followed big game south. As the ice melted and sea levels rose, these Native Americans ended up staying and thrived on the peninsula for thousands of years. By the time the first Spanish conquistadors arrived, there were over 250,000 Native Americans living on the peninsula. Some of these first early tribes were the Tocobago, Timucua, and the Calusa. In 1527, a Spanish road map showed a settlement near the Rio de la Paz. The arrival of the Spanish turned out to be disastrous to these Native American tribes. Within 150 years, the majority of the pre-Columbian Native American peoples of Florida had been mercilessly slaughtered. Many of those who had not succumbed to diseases such as Yellow Fever or Scarlet Fever were either killed or enslaved by the Spaniards. Little is left of these first Native Americans cultures in Trenton except for scant archeological records including a few personal artifacts. Eventually the remnants of these tribes would merge with Bell Indians who arrived from the north and become the Seminole Indian tribe.
