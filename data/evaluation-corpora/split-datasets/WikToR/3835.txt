Kalam (Pashto: کالام ‎) is a cool heaven for tourists which is located at distance of 99 km from mingora in the northern upper reaches of Swat valley along the bank of Suvastu river in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Kalam is surrounded by lush green hills, thick forests and bestowed with mesmeric lakes, meadows and waterfalls which are worth seen features of the landscape. It is the birth place of Swat river which forms with confluence of two major tributaries of Gabral river & Ushu river. It is a spacious sub-valley of Swat, at an elevation of about 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) above sea level, and providing rooms for a small but fertile plateau above the river for farming. Here, the metalled road ends and shingle road leads to the Usho and Utror valleys. From Matiltan some snow-capped mountains are visible including Mount Falaksar 5,918 meters (19,416 feet), and another unnamed peak 6,096 meters (20,000 feet) high. There are a lot of grand hotels in Kalam, where one can stay for night and enjoy the cool breeze of Swat river.
