Barak is a Kyrgyz village (40°40′N 72°46′E) which is an exclave situated within Uzbekistan. Administratively it is part of Kara-Suu District in Kyrgyzstan's Osh Region. The exclave of Barak is encircled by Andijan Region, Uzbekistan. It is a relatively small town of approximately 600 people located in the Fergana Valley. Alternative estimates list the village consisting of 153 families (approximately 1,000 residents). It is located about 4 km north-west of the road from Osh (Kyrgyzstan) to Khodjaabad (Uzbekistan) near the Kyrgyz–Uzbek border in the direction toward Andijan (40°47′N 72°20′E). This places it approximately 1.5 km from the Uzbek/Kyrgyz border, near Ak-Tash village. Kyrgyzstan's 1991 pre-independence border is the de jure international border, but much of it is hotly disputed with its neighbors. In August 1999, the area around Barak was occupied by Uzbekistan, cutting it off from Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces dug up and blockaded the road to Ak-Tash while also allegedly seizing large areas of Kyrgyz land that had been loaned in the Soviet era but never returned. They entrenched themselves within much of Kyrgyz border territory and refused to leave. Barak became a de facto enclave only 1.5 km from the shifted main border. Four Uzbek enclaves and Barak are major sticking points in border delimitation talks, and disputes center on the areas of Barak, Sokh, Gava and Gavasay (stream). (Map)
