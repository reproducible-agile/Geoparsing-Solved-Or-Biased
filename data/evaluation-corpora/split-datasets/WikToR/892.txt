The town of Montgomery was founded in the middle of the Lake Creek Settlement by W. W. Shepperd in July, 1837 on 200 acres (0.81 km2) of land that had originally been part of the John Corner League. Shepperd had established the first store in the Lake Creek Settlement in 1835. W. W. Shepperd and his partner John Wyatt Moody named the town Montgomery. John Wyatt Moody was the First Auditor of the Republic of Texas and had lived in Alabama where he was the County Clerk of Montgomery County, Alabama. The town of Montgomery, Texas, was named after Montgomery County, Alabama, which was named after Major Lemuel P. Montgomery who was killed in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814). Montgomery became the first county seat of Montgomery County shortly after the county was created on December 14, 1837. Dr. Charles B. Stewart lived in Montgomery when he headed a committee appointed by Mirabeau B. Lamar to design an official flag for the Republic of Texas. A copy of his drawing is in the Nat H. Davis Museum Complex & Museum at 14264 Liberty Street, Montgomery, Texas.
