Georgetown is a Canadian town and the county seat of Kings County, Prince Edward Island. As of 2011, the population was 693. This area of eastern Prince Edward Island traces its history of human settlement to the Mi'kmaq Nation which inhabited the area. These people were referred to as "Epegoitnag" and for them, the region was an Acadian forest wilderness containing wild game, as well as fruit, berries and wild nuts for gathering, as well as plentiful marine resources in the nearby rivers and Northumberland Strait. The land in this area was called "Samkook" which translates to 'the land of the sandy shore'. Georgetown lies opposite Brudenell Point, which divides the Brudenell River to the north from the Montague River to the south. Brudenell Point was the location of the first permanent Acadian settlement on what the French called Ile-Saint-Jean. Here, entrepreneur Jean Pierre Roma landed in 1732 with approximately 100 settlers to begin a commercial settlement to grow food and catch fish for provisioning the French military garrison at Fortress of Louisbourg on Ile-Royale (now Cape Breton Island). French settlers called the area Trois-Rivieres (Three Rivers). The British burned the village in 1745, the same time they took control of Port-la-Joye.
