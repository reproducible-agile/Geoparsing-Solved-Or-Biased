Banga is a third class municipality in the province of Aklan, Philippines. This small town has repeatedly won national competitions for the "Most Beautiful Town" contests in the country. It is the site of the Aklan State University. Banga is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. The history of Banga dates back to the 15th century upon the arrival in Panay Island of the Ten Datus from Borneo. While some sceptics considered the account a legend, Banganhons still believe that one of the rulers named Datu Manduyog, ruled over the area with his seat of government located in Bakan, the town's older name. His capital was at the foot of the Manduyog Hill that was named after him. Being a legitimate successor to Datu Dangandanan who ruled what was called Akean in the late 1390s, Datu Manduyog became the Akeanon ruler in 1437 and made Bakan the capital. Another version of Banga's history from Panublion cited that Banga's ancient site was the present location of Malinao. In 1792, the town transferred across the Aklan River to the foot of Manduyog Hill. Several prominent families decided to remain in the “old town”, which became a barrio and named Malinao after a placid tributary of the Aklan River.
