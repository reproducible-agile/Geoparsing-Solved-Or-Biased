Marino [Irish: Muiríne] is a Northside suburb located in Dublin, Ireland. Marino encompasses the area within the boundaries of Sion Hill Road, Gracepark Road, Philipsburgh Avenue (north of Lynch's), Malahide Road and Shelmartin Terrace. Marino borders other Northside areas such as Fairview, Donnycarney and Clontarf. It is two kilometres from the GPO in O'Connell Street. The area is served by the Clontarf Road DART station. The townland of Marino was carved out of the townland of Donnycarney which was granted to the Corporation of Dublin following the dissolution of The Priory of All Hallows in the reign of King Henry VIII. The area was developed for housing in the late 1920s and 1930s on the former estate lands of the Earl of Charlemont in the civil parish of Clonturk (now Marino, Fairview and Drumcondra). It is notable as one of the first examples, in the newly formed Irish state, of an affordable housing project. It is heavily influenced by the garden city movement. The area consists of about 1,300 houses built for the most part of concrete, which was an unusual building material at that time in Ireland. The houses were built by a private contractor using a proportion of immigrant German builders. The houses each cost £657 to build (approximately €40,000 at today's costs ).
