White River (Afrikaans: Witrivier) is a small holiday and farming town situated just north of Nelspruit in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The farms in the region produce tropical fruits, vegetables, flowers and timber. After the Boer War the British demarcated land on the Emanzimhlope River, a tributary of the Crocodile River. Emanzimhlope is Swazi for White Waters. The land was used to demobilise British soldiers and the first manager of the settlement was Tom Lawrence (snr), after whom the longest street in the town is still named. The farming tradition of the community that settled here after the Anglo-Boer War has remained virtually unchanged to this day. Lord Milner's (administrator of the defeated Transvaal) attache, the aforementioned Tom Lawrence, demarcated land on the 'Emanzimhlope' - a tributary of the Crocodile River whose name translates from the Swazi as 'White Waters' - to demobilised British Anglo-Boer War soldiers. After a 26 km canal to channel water from the river was built, the new settlers planted trees and established new cultivation methods. The agriculture involves largely the production of tropical fruits, vegetables, flowers and timber and tobacco, and is one of the most fertile in the province.
