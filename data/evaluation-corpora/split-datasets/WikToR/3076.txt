Spring Valley is a census-designated place (CDP) in San Diego County, California. The population was 28,205 at the 2010 census. The name "Spring Valley" may also refer to a wider area including the Spring Valley CDP, La Presa and part of the neighborhood of Casa de Oro (which extends into La Mesa). There are claims that the Greater Spring Valley area has over 100,000 residents [1] although this claims large areas that are actually unincorporated parts of La Mesa and El Cajon. Spring Valley is served by the 91977 and 91978 ZIP codes. Spring Valley is named for the natural spring located there. It was long the home of the Kumeyaay tribe, who called it Neti or Meti. Spanish conquerors drove off the natives and used the area for cattle, calling it El aguaje de San Jorge (St. George's Spring). In 1863 Judge Augustus S. Ensworth of San Diego filed a claim for a 160 acre (647,000 mÂ²) ranch that included the spring. The ranch, and the small adobe house he built there, were sold to Rufus King Porter and later to historian Hubert Howe Bancroft. The adobe is now a National Historic Landmark.
