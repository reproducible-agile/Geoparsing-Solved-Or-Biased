It is about 4 miles south of Thirsk and near the A168 road.It mainly consists of farmland as well as an industrial estate. It has a population of 518. In 1870, John Marius Wilson's said that: Dalton, a township in Topcliffe parish, N. R. Yorkshire; on the Great North of England railway, 4¼ miles S of Thirsk. Acres, 1, 247. Real property, £1, 709. Pop., 307. Houses, 77. There are chapels for Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists. . In 1890 Dalton was made up of 2,649 acres of land and 177 acres were covered in plantations. Some of it was elevated moorland and the rest was fertile land. A small ‘chapel of ease’ was created here in 1839 in which a service used to be held every second Sunday morning of the month, and every evening on all the other Sundays. In 1855 the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was created which was described as “a very small and plain building”. To the South of Dalton there are the remains of a camp called ‘Castle Steads’, if you continue further South there is a block of stone called ‘Stone Man’ which used to be a large landmark. However, these stones were taken away to make fences. A mile South-east of the Stone Man a stone chest was found which had a ‘kale pot’ which is said to have contained money. Dalton is mentioned in the Domesday book. Dalton had 10.2 households in 1066 which is quite a small amount in comparison to other parishes according to the Domesday book. The total tax assessed is 5.2 geld units, which is quite large for a parish. The Lord in 1066 was called Bernwulf and the value to the lord was £4. The Lord as well as tenant-in-chief in 1086 was William of Percy and the value was £5. Dalton had 15 ploughlands, one mill, one church and four furlongs worth of woodland.
