Kelso is a suburb in the City of Townsville, Queensland, Australia, the last of three suburbs along Riverway Drive. Kelso is the only suburb on Riverway Drive that has homes backing onto the Ross River. Kelso was named after Scottish immigrants, and early settlers, Mary and James Kelso, who had cattle property in 1878 called Laudham Park on Five Head Creek. To make way for construction of the Ross River Dam in 1970, the Townsville City Council resumed 1620ha of the property's best grazing land. At its peak, Laudham Park stretched for more than 40,000ha along both banks of the Upper Ross River to the foothills of Mount Stuart and out to the Pinnacles part of Hervey Range. Most of what was Laudham Park is today under water due to the construction of the dam and the rest is now the suburb of Kelso. The first residential blocks started selling back in 1966. Kelso is connected to Townsville by the Sunbus Townsville. This is also a source of transport for most students who go to schools around Kelso and Townsville, to and from school.
