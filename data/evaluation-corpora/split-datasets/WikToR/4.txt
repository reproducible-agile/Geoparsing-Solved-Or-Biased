Santa Maria (formerly Imelda) is a fifth class municipality in the province of Romblon, Philippines. Santa Maria was known in Spanish times as Cagbagacay, after a bamboo plant called "bagacay" in the local dialect, which was in abundance in the area. Back then it was still a barrio of Guintigui-an town. In 1910, barrio Cagbagacay was renamed Concepcion after its patron the Immaculada Concepcion. On 12 September 1982, barrio Concepcion (Norte) together with barrios Bonga and Concepcion Sur were organized and created into a new municipality by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 234, authored by Assemblyman Nemesio Ganan Jr. The new municipality was named "Imelda", in honor of then First Lady Imelda Marcos, as well as to distinguish the town from Concepcion municipality on Maestro de Campo Island, also in Romblon. After the People Power Revolution in 1986 which toppled the regime of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the town was renamed Santa Maria on 17 April 1988 by virtue of Republic Act No. 6651, again in honor of its patron the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Three new barangays were added to the municipality: San Isidro, Paroyhog, and Sto. Nino.
