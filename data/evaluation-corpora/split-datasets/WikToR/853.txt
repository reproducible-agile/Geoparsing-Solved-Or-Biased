Rincon is a census-designated place (CDP) in Doña Ana County, New Mexico, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the CDP population was 271. It is part of the Las Cruces Metropolitan Statistical Area. Rincon is located at 32°40′21″N 107°3′58″W (32.672457, -107.066132), adjacent to Hatch, New Mexico in the valley of the Rio Grande. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2), all of it land. Rincon is 33 miles north of Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Interstate 25, and approximately 20 miles south of Spaceport America, a new purpose-built spaceport being built by the New Mexico Spaceport Authority with State and county funding. Spaceport construction has generated some 800 temporary jobs on the site, but some Rincon residents have been skeptical that the spaceport will generate as many jobs in the long term as supporters claimed in the runup to public funding. As of January 2012, one company, Virgin Galactic, plans to employ about 150 persons at the spaceport site.
