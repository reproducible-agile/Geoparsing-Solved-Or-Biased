Gilbert is a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,799 at the 2010 census. State Highway 37 (MN 37) and State Highway 135 (MN 135) are two of the main routes in Gilbert. Gilbert is part of the Quad Cities of Virginia, Eveleth, and Mountain Iron. Gilbert gets its name from E. J. Gilbert, who led the exploration of the McKinley mine property in the 1890s. Gilbert was platted in 1907. A post office has been in operation at Gilbert since 1907. Gilbert is home to one of Minnesotaâ€™s most well known OHV parks. The Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle State Recreation Area consists of 1,200 acres (5 km2) of land with 36 miles (58 km) of trails. Gilbert is also the location of Lake Ore-be-gone, a former mining pit now used for fishing. It used to be for swimming until recently when the water levels dropped around 10 ft., making it unsafe to swim in. The town of Gilbert was actually moved for the pit. The town was once known as the red light district of the Iron Range, and planned a 'Whorehouse Days' festival for two days in July 2005.[1] However, this festival was cancelled due to objections by the city council.
