Harvey is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. Harvey is on the West Bank of the Mississippi River, within the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 22,226 at the 2000 census. Harvey is located at 29°53′28″N 90°04′09″W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 7.0 square miles (18 km2), of which 6.7 square miles (17 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) (5.11%) is water. The original owner of the land was Jean-Baptiste d'Estrehan de Beaupre, royal treasurer and comptroller for the French Louisiana colony. His plantation slaves initially began digging the ditch that would become the Harvey Canal, from the banks of the Mississippi River to the back of Bayou Barataria. Years later, the German settlers who would commence the final widening of the ditch with wooden shovels were paid off by d'Estrehan in small land parcels located down river in Mechanicsham, now the city of Gretna. Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan would settle his home where the ditch met the river banks, naming the settlement Cosmopolite City.
