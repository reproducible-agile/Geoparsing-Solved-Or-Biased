Yablonovka (Russian: Яблоновка) is a rural locality (a selo) in Rovensky District of Saratov Oblast, Russia, located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) south of the city of Engels on the left bank of the Volga River. It was founded by Volga Germans in 1767 and until 1941 was known as Lauwe; other German names for the settlement were Laube and Schönfeld. It was founded on August 19, 1767 by the colonial agency LeRoy and Pictet and 169 Lutheran immigrants from Germany, following Catherine the Great's manifesto of July 22, 1763, which guaranteed settlers in the Russian Empire free transport and monetary support in reaching their new colonies, free choice of settlement location, freedom of trade, freedom from taxation for thirty years, interest-free loans for ten years, freedom of religion, freedom from conscription in perpetuity, and freedom of return to their homelands, but at their own expense. The settlement was named Lauwe after the first elder of the village. Its original demarcation consisted of 4,455 desiatinas. The first forty-seven settler families came from Bavaria (Nuremberg), Baden, Hesse (Darmstadt and Neu-Isenburg), the Palatinate, the Rhineland, Saxony, and Brandenburg. It was one of the ten colonies established by LeRoy and Pictet south of Saratov on the "meadow" (eastern) side of the Volga and along its eastern tributary, the Terlyk. In later years, it was also known under the German names of Laube and Schönfeld.
