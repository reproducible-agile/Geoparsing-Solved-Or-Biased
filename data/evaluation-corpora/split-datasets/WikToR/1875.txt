Moscow /ˈmɒskoʊ/ is a city in Stevens County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 310. The settlement of Moscow was established in 1887. One tradition says, the community was named for a member of de Soto's expedition, the maestro de campo (field commander) Luis de Moscoso (the source mistakenly indicates Francisco Coronado southwest expedition, but at this time Moscoso was a member of de Soto's expedition, furthermore he took command of the expedition after de Soto's death). During the settlement name registration there were a series of mistakes. The residents, in their application for a post office, had shortened it to Mosco. A postal clerk in Washington, upon receipt of their petition, being in a helpful spirit, and thinking the hay-seeds in the west didn't know their spelling, added a "w" to the name, changing it to Moscow. The first post office in Moscow was established on April 28, 1888, when it was moved from Valparaiso (now ghost town), which was located approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) southeast of Moscow.
