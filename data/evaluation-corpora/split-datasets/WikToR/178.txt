San Andres (formerly Parpagoja, Salado, and Despujols) is a fifth class municipality in the province of Romblon, Philippines. San Andres was originally a barangay of Odiongan which became a municipality on 1920. During the pre-Spanish era, it was a native settlement of nipa huts known as Parpagoja, named after a rare large bird that had its nest among the thicket along the river where settlement was located. Among the first Spaniards to reach Parpagoha during the later half of the 19th century was Don Jose de Tiran, a military commander of Romblon who set out an inspection trip of the surrounding villages. On reaching the place he ordered a civil guard to fetch a glass of water from nearby well. The water turned out to be salty and the Spaniard yelled "salado!", issuing an official order to that effect. Thus, Parpagoha came to be known as Salado. In 1882, a prominent resident of Salado named Rufino Lea単o was accused of a crime by an influential Spaniard, Don Barcelo. He succeeded in having Lea単o imprisoned without trial in the provincial jail of Capiz, to which Romblon then belonged to as a sub-province. Years later, the Spanish Governor-General Eulogio Despujol (1891-1893) visited Capiz, and Lea単o successfully sought an audience with him. Governor Despujol found Lea単o innocent and set him free. On reaching his hometown, he successfully petitioned the provincial governor to change the name of Salado to Despujols in honor of the Governor-General.
