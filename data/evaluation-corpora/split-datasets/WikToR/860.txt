Buenavista is a second-class municipality in the province of Guimaras, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 46,703 people. The town acts as a cheaper link between Panay and Negros, as opposed to taking a ship directly between the two islands. Buenavista is located at the northern tip of Guimaras Island, and is one of the five towns comprising the province of Guimaras. The northern and north-west part of the town overlooks Panay Island and the north-east portion faces Negros Island. Iloilo Strait lies between the town and Panay, and Guimaras Strait lies between the town and Negros. The McArthur wharf serves as the municipal wharf for Buenavista and part of San Lorenzo is used by passengers from the neighboring Panay Island in going to Negros Province and vice versa. This transportation route serves as a cheaper link, rather than taking a ship. Buenavista's terrain ranges from plains (nearly level in the central and north-west coastal areas) to mountains (north-western part). The climate is mild and cool, due to its being bounded by the sea on the three directions.
