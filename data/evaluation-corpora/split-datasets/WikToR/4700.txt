Grantham is an unincorporated community in Upper Allen Township, Cumberland County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, best known today for the Christian liberal arts college, Messiah College, whose students make up most of its population. There is no industry, no mass-commercialization, and very little night life outside of the college. The population of Grantham is 85-90% between the ages of 18 and 25 years old - if you only count the student population. The actual residents number between 600-650, a large number of which are Messiah alumni, employees or parents of the same. Founded in the early twentieth century, Grantham was built around the rapidly growing industry built along the nearby railway line, which supplied the labor and logistical support to the macaroni factory run by Messiah College's first president S.R. Smith. After the macaroni plant went out of business, the facility was used for aircraft parts and a greeting card business. It was destroyed by fire prior to 1957 and stood derelict for many years; eventually it was demolished to provide a new maintenance facility for the growing college.
