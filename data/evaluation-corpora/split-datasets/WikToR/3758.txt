Montgomery County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, the population was 50,219. The county seat is Fonda. The county was named in honor of Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 at the Battle of Quebec. It was created in 1772 as Tryon County and in 1784 was renamed Montgomery County. Montgomery County comprises the Amsterdam, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area. The county borders the north and south banks of the Mohawk River. In 1784, following end of the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County. This change was to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died in 1775 attempting to capture the city of Quebec during the Revolutionary War. It replaced the name formerly honoring the last provincial governor of New York. In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, as it also included the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.
