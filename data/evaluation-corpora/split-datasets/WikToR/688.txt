Alma is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 842 at the 2010 census. The source of the town name is uncertain. It may come from the Latin word for "nourishing", or it may be named for a city in Germany. The Town of Alma is on the southern edge of Allegany County and is southwest of the Village of Wellsville. The area was first settled around 1833. The Town of Alma was established in 1854 from part of the Town of Willing. From 1881 to January 1893 several of the settlements in the Township (most notably Allentown) were on the Wellsville-Eldred Main Line of the Bradford, Eldred & Cuba Railroad (BE&C). The BE&C was a 36" narrow-gauge railroad built to serve the Allegany County oil boom. With the end of the boom and loss of the passenger and freight traffic therefrom the railroad entered receivership (bankruptcy) and was abandoned. Today the railheads for Alma Township are Wellsville and Friendship. Remnants of the railroad bed for the BE&C can be seen in the village of West Clarksville between the village and Dodge Creek behind the Clarksville store.James E. Lewis, a resident in West Clarksville from 1936-1950. This railroad bed was one of my playgrounds with my bicycle. The Clarksville store was in my family for three generations: Frank Windsor, James E. Windsor, and my dad Malcolm W. Lewis.
