Santo Domingo (or Sto. Domingo) is a third class municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 50,983 people. As an agricultural town, Santo Domingo is famous for its scenic agricultural landscape amid its Philippine duck raising industry. In Barangay Baloc along the Maharlika Highway is the Mariano Noriel landmark park and plaza. It is bordered by the municipalities of Talavera and Quezon. During the last quarter of the 17th century, Ilocos and Bulacan natives migrated to Sto. Domingo. They found in the settlement buri palms. Therefore, these people called the site, Pulong Buli. Sto. Domingo de Guzman became their Patron saint. The settlement became a Municipio but was later demoted to a mere barangay of Talavera, Nueva Ecija in 1903. It was later reverted to the political status of Municipality. The Alejos, Juans, Samatras, Salamancas, Andreses, Pascuals and Tomases were the descendants of the founders of the town. During the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945, various local guerrillas and Hukbalahap communist groups fought side by side at Santo Domingo, aided by the Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units. Following the Allied liberation in 1945, over 4,500 Filipino soldiers and guerrillas had been killed or wounded, and 29,000 Japanese troops killed or captured in action.
