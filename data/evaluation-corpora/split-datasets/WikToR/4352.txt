Davis is a city in Garvin and Murray counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 2,683 at the 2010 census. Davis is named after Samuel H. Davis, who moved to Washita in what was then Indian Territory in 1887. Davis owned a dry goods store, which was four miles south of the current town of Davis. Davis submitted a petition for a Santa Fe depot to be built near his store, and the petition was accepted. In 1890, he also successfully petitioned for a post office to be built. The post office was supposed to be named after Nelson Chigley a Chickasaw Indian who owned the land on which the town was to be built. Chigley was already an Indian Territory name, so it was named after Davis. The town was established on November 16, 1898. It is located twenty-three miles north of Ardmore and twenty-three miles south of Pauls Valley. By 1900, Davis had fifty-seven businesses, two banks, ten doctors, three dentists, and three lawyers. Cotton farming was a common occupation in Davis, which was in one of the best cotton producing sections in Oklahoma.
