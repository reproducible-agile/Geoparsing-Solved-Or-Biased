Huntington is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 11,267 at the 2010 census. To the east is Belle Haven, Fairfax County, Virginia and to the south Groveton, Virginia. Its main component is the namesake Huntington subdivision, a late-1940s neighborhood of mainly duplex homes. In June 2006, the lower-lying northern section was ravaged by floods due to a torrential rainstorm that sent adjoining Cameron Run over its banks. Nevertheless, it remains popular with first-time home buyers due largely to its proximity to the Huntington Metro station, the southern terminus of Metrorail's Yellow Line. There are also several high-rise apartment and condominium complexes on and near Route 1 where much of the CDP's remaining population resides. The area is included in ZIP code 22303, which the United States Postal Service considers to be unincorporated Alexandria. Huntington is located at 38°47′33″N 77°4′20″W (38.792563, -77.072120). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.0 km²), all of it land.
