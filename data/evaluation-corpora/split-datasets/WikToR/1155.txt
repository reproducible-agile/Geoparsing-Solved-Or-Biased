Ceres is a locality of Geelong, Victoria, Australia. As one of the highest points in Geelong, Ceres has a lookout which overlooks the city. In the 2011 census, Ceres had a population of 201 people. The Ceres area was first settled by squatters in the late 1830s, and the lots of the Barrabool Parish were advertised in 1839, with the land being sold on 5 February 1840. There was reportedly "plenty of competition" for the Barrabool Hills lands, and the area became part of "Roslin", owned by David Fisher. The government had not provided for a settlement in the Barrabool Parish, and Fisher, after selling much of his estate in 1846, advertised a section of the remainder for sale as the new village of Ceres in March 1850. The town is presumably named after the Roman goddess of agriculture or less likely the dwarf planet. The first business to open in Ceres was the Wheat Sheaf Inn in September 1850, which became a social centre for much of the Barrabool district. A second hotel, the Rising Sun, opened in 1853. The Post Office opened on 14 February 1856. In 1856, the village was reported to have the Seidel Bros. vineyard, a blacksmith's forge and quarrier, a physician, a store, a shoemaker, a post office, a butcher, a surgeon, the two hotels, and a second forge. Coal was first discovered at Ceres in 1842, and a shaft sunk in 1854, but despite much excitement economical quantities were never found. A meeting at Ceres on 10 November 1855 agreed to build a cemetery, which subsequently opened as the Barrabool Hills Cemetery (now Highton Cemetery) in modern Highton.
