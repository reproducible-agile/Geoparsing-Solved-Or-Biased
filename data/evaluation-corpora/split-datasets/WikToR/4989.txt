Moe (/ˈmoʊ.i/ MOH-ee) is a town in Latrobe Valley in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. It is approximately 130 kilometres (80 mi) east of the CBD of Melbourne, 45 kilometres (30 mi) due south of the peak of Mount Baw Baw in the Great Dividing Range and features views of the Baw Baw Ranges to the north and Strzelecki Ranges to the south. At the 2011 census, Moe itself had a population of 15,292 (including Newborough). It is administered by the Latrobe City Council. Moe was originally known as The Mowie, then Little Moi. The town's name is believed to derive from a Kurnai (local Indigenous) word meaning "swamp land". Moe is a navigation point and stopover for tourists en route to Erica, the historic goldfields township of Walhalla, the Walhalla Goldfields Railway and Mount Baw Baw. Lake Narracan is nearby, and Moe is home to the annual Moe Cup horse races, the Moe Jazz Festival and the recreated historic settlement Old Gippstown. The city has locally produced Aboriginal/Koorie art and is regularly home to local Australian Football & Netball Finals in the Gippsland League Football & Netball League and the Mid Gippsland Football League. The region is represented by Gippsland Power in the TAC Cup competition.
