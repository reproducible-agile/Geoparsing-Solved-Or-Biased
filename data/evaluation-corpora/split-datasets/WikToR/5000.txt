Margate is a residential suburb of the Moreton Bay Region in the east of the Redcliffe peninsula, approximately 26 kilometres (16 mi) north-northeast of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. Margate Beach, a 2 km redeveloped stretch spanning the length of the suburb, features a timber boardwalk, viewing shelters and seating, and barbecue facilities, with views to Moreton Island over sandy beaches and Moreton Bay. The redeveloped boardwalk was completed in 2002 in a bid to beautify the area. The boardwalk covers the original cement steps to Margate Beach which are still visible and in use further down the waterfront at Suttons Beach, Redcliffe. The Margate CBD underwent a $6M major redevelopment aimed at modernising the shopping precinct, making the area more attractive and comfortable, and a distinctive centre with a strong identity. It was completed in November 2007. Margate's urban centre, known as Margate Village is home to a string of retail and commercial businesses including a local shopping centre which is anchored by a Woolworths & Terry White Chemists. Margate Village provides the higher order retail and commercial role of a centre serving mainly Redcliffe City residents, in comparison to other urban villages in Redcliffe City. Currently, Margate has a building height restriction of six storeys in zoned areas along Duffield Road towards Margate Beach.
