Alma (Arabic: علما‎) was a Palestinian Arab village in the Safad Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War on October 30, 1948 during Operation Hiram. It was located 10 km north of Safad. In 1945 it had a population of 950. 'Alma had several nearby khirbas and architectural fragments with inscriptions from an ancient synagogue. Alma was situated in the heart of upper Galilee in the middle of a fertile plain, about 4 km south of the Lebanese border. Ceramics from the Byzantine era have been found here. The Crusaders called the village "Alme." Several ancient ruins remain and three inscribed architectural fragments in Hebrew and Aramaic from an ancient synagogue were found on the surface of the village site between 1914 and 1957. While travelling though the region in the 12th century CE, Benjamin of Tudela noted that Alma contained fifty Jewish inhabitants and, "a large cemetery of the Israelites." Remains of a ruined watch-tower was found on the crest of the ridge, and a quarter of a mile south of those there were three perfect dolmens, not very large.
