Jinhua , is a prefecture-level city in central Zhejiang province in eastern China. It borders the provincial capital of Hangzhou to the northwest, Quzhou to the southwest, Lishui to the south, Taizhou to the east, and Shaoxing to the northeast. Its population was 5,361,572 at the 2010 census including 1,077,245 in the built-up area made of two urban districts (not including the satellite city of Lanxi, which has become essentially a suburban offshoot of Jinhua's main urban area). The cities of Dongyang and Yiwu are under the jurisdiction of the prefecture-level city of Jinhua in the strict administrative sense, but are often regarded as separate entities; these two cities make up the contiguous Yiwu-Dongyang metropolitan region, with a built-up area of 2,038,413 inhabitants, which is bigger than that of the urban center of Jinhua itself. Jinhua is rich in red soil and forest resources. The Jinhua or Wu River flows through the Lan and Fuchun to the Qiantang River beside Hangzhou, which flows into Hangzhou Bay and the East China Sea. In mediaeval China, it formed part of the water network feeding supplies to the southern end of the Grand Canal. It is best known for its dry-cured Jinhua ham.
