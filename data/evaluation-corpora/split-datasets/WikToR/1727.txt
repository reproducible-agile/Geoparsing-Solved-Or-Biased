Georgetown is a city in Quitman County, Georgia, United States. It is at the Alabama-Georgia state line next to Walter F. George Lake. The population was 973 at the 2000 census. In 2006, Georgetown and Quitman County voted to consolidate their governments, becoming the smallest such consolidated entity in the Lower 48 states. Settled in the early 1830s, Georgetown was first named Tobanana for the nearby creek. The Tobanana Post Office was established on January 10, 1833. On September 21, 1836, the name of the town was changed to "Georgetown" after the historic neighborhood in Washington, D.C. Georgetown was designated in 1859 as the county seat of Quitman County and was laid out as a town by order of the Inferior Court. The town was incorporated by an act of the legislature on December 9, 1859. A brigade of federal cavalry, commanded by General Benjamin H. Grierson, camped for a time near Georgetown on the banks of the Tobanana Creek at the close of the American Civil War. Georgetown was destroyed by fire in 1903; every building except for the post office and three houses were destroyed.
