Baby, The Stars Shine Bright (株式会社　ベイビー、ザ スターズ シャイン ブライト, Kabushiki Kaisha Beibī, Za Sutāzu Shain Buraito) (shortened to 'Baby' or 'BTSSB') is the name of a Japanese clothing boutique chain created in 1988 by Akinori Isobe and his wife, Fumiyo. The original fashion house is in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. Baby, The Stars Shine Bright specializes in Lolita fashion and, like Manifesteange Metamorphose temps de fille, their main focus is the subcategory Sweet Lolita. Baby, The Stars Shine Bright opened their first international retail store in Paris, France, and opened their first North American retail store in San Francisco, California, USA on August 15, 2009. The New York City branch of Kinokuniya occasionally sold clothing from the label, including dresses, headdresses, shoes and socks, but only received shipments sparingly. As mentioned in Shimotsuma Monogatari, the label's name was taken from the title of the album Baby the Stars Shine Bright by English pop music group Everything But the Girl. The "Alice and the Pirates" line of Baby, the Stars Shine Bright was created in 2004. It has a strong pirate and pirate-punk theme with bolder colours and more items suitable for Ouji and Aristocrat styles. A store devoted to this line opened in Harajuku on 25 August 2006. It is located in the bottom floor of Laforet. In 2011, Alice and the Pirates, along with Baby, The Stars Shine Bright designed the costumes for the television animation The Mystic Archives of Dantalian.
