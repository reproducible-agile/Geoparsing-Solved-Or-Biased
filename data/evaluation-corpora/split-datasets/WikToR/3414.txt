Greenwich is an unincorporated community in Prince William County, in the U.S. state of Virginia. Greenwich in the American Revolution In January, 1779 captured British and Hessian troops were led through Greenwich on their way to prisoner of war camps located near Charlottesville, Virginia. Greenwich in the Civil War Although several engagements occurred nearby, Greenwich escaped unscathed, in part because of the creative actions of resident Charles Green, an Englishman. Green flew the British flag over his Carpenter's Gothic Home, The Lawn, built in 1855 (burned 1924). Three years later, he donated land for Greenwich Presbyterian Church. During the war, when Union troops threatened to appropriate it for a hospital, Green claimed it was neutral British property for use only as a church. The Federals relented and left it untouched. Both Union and Confederate forces passed by here several times in 1862-63. On August 27, 1862, just before the Second Battle of Manassas, Federal divisions under Gens. Jesse Reno and Isaac Stevens, as well as Col. Orlando Poe's brigade, bivouacked here. They marched to Manassas Junction the next day in pursuit of Confederate Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's force.
