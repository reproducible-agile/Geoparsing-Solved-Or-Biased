Matanzas is a coastal village famous for its beach, located in the commune of Navidad in the O'Higgins Region of Chile. Matanzas is located in the north west of Cardenal Caro Province, O'Higgins Region, and forms part of the commune of Navidad, Chile. Is located 160 kilometres south of Santiago and 58 kilometres north of Pichilemu. Matanzas was a famous harbour during the time of the colonization of Chile, and was the place where part of the Spanish army responsible for the occupation of Chile’s Zona Central disembarked. The place was also frequented by pirates. The name "Matanzas" (Spanish for “slaughter” or “killing”) comes from the sea lion hunting and processing industry, which were used to provide oil and other goods. A local story tells of a visit from Sir Francis Drake, who disembarked and was well received in Matanzas. Another tells of a sunken Spanish galleon out off the coast. The beach at Matanzas is known for its fine grey sand and year-round windy weather, making it an ideal place to practice surfing, boogyboarding, stand up paddling, windsurfing and kitesurfing. Matanzas is also known for its rich fauna. The islets of Lobos and Pajaros provide a nesting ground for several species and the English scientist Charles Darwin discovered 31 species around Matanzas in his 1846 analysis of the Navidad Formation. The area includes many species of molluscs that were last reviewed extensively by Philippi (1887).
