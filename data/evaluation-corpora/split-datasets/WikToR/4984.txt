Guildford is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, 12 km northeast of the city. Its local government area is the City of Swan. Guildford was established in 1829 on the Swan River, being sited near a permanent fresh water supply. During Captain Stirling's exploration for a suitable site to establish a colony on the western side of the Australian continent in the late 1820s, the exploration party of boats found a fresh water stream across the river from the site of Guildford which they called Success Hill. Guildford was primarily the centre of the Swan River Colony before Perth succeeded in being the dominant location on the Swan Coastal Plain. Guildford was the home of Lew Whiteman and his family. The Whiteman family were responsible for the establishment of various industries. The Whiteman family established Mussel Pool as a picnic area for their employees. This land and the purchase of surrounding land by the State Government in 1978 was used to create Whiteman Park. The original home of the Whiteman family are now Tea rooms; the house is one of the oldest standing homes in Western Australia.
