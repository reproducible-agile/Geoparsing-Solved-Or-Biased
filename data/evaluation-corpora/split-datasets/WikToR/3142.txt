Heshan (Chinese: 鹤山) is a county-level city of Jiangmen City in the southern part of Guangdong Province, China with a total land area of 1,108.3 square kilometres (427.9 sq mi) and a population of 360,000. If migrants this figure rises to around 550,000 persons residing within the city's borders. There are approximately 360,000 people of Heshan origin or descent living in other parts of the world. Situated about 60 kilometres (37 mi) south west of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, Heshan occupies a strategic location on the Pearl River Delta, commanding the northern gateway to Jiangmen's five prefectures. Along the opposite bank of the same river, lie the two municipalities of Nanhai and Shunde. Heshan is around one hour from Hong Kong and Macau by road. The city's harbour can accommodate vessels of up to 3,000 long tons (3,050 t). Ships ply from here to Hong Kong directly. Heshan was decreed as a prefecture in 1732 during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor in the Qing dynasty. In 1993, its administrative status was changed to a county-level city. Its name, which means 'Mount Crane', was given to it because of a mountain within its boundary that closely resembles the shape of that bird.
