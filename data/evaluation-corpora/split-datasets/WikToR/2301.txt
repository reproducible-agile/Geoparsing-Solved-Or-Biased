Billings is a town in northwest Noble County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 509 at the 2010 census, an increase from 436 at the 2000 census. It was the childhood home of Oklahoma governor Henry Bellmon. Billings was called "White Rock", when it was founded in 1893, at the time of the Cherokee Strip Land Run. It was then 3 miles (4.8 km) east and 2 miles (3.2 km)south of its present site. Its economy was based on agriculture in the surrounding area. The Enid and Tonkawa Railway (acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway in 1900) built a spur line out from North Enid in 1899. The railroad, however, did not go through White Rock, so the residents soon moved to the present location. The new town opened October 23, 1899. The town was renamed for M. O. Billings, a director of the Billings Town Company. Billings is located at 36°32′06″N 97°25′46″W. It is 35 miles (56 km) from Enid and Ponca City. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2), all of it land.
