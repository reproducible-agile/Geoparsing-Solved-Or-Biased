Nako is a village in the Himalayas of northern India, located near the Indo-China border in the Trans-Himalayan region of Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh. Nako Lake is a prominent feature here where it borders the village. Nako Monastery, dated to 1025, is located in the village as well as several other Buddhist chortens. Nako is the largest village at an elevation of 3,625 metres (11,893 ft) (3,662 metres (12,014 ft) is also mentioned) in the Hangrang Valley with the backdrop of Reo Purgyal which has an elevation of 6,816 metres (22,362 ft) and is the highest mountain in Himachal Pradesh. The village is now on a more stable location near the Nako Lake (formed by the slopes of the mountains of Reo Purgyal), compared to the opposite bank across the Nako river where it was located earlier and then shifted because of tectonic upliftment of the site. As of 2002, the village had a population of 416. Access to the village is from a branch road of 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the National Highway 22. It is 117 kilometres (73 mi) away from Kalpa. Nako Monastery in the upper part of the village and the Nako Lake are important land marks in the village. Apples and Sun dried apricots are the agricultural produce from the village.
