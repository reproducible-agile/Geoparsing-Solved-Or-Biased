The population was 1,055 at the 2010 census. Four limited access highways, I-95, I-295, I-495, and Delaware Route 141 intersect within one mile (1.6 km) of the town. Newport is located at 39°42′48″N 75°36′29″W (39.713312, −75.608002). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), of which 2.22% is water. Prior to European settlement, the Minquas (or Susquehannock) peoples lived in and around modern-day Newport. This heritage is reflected in the name of the Minquas Fire Company, Newport's volunteer fire company. The first land grant for the area were awarded to the Duke of York in 1641. In 1731, longtime area resident and businessman John Justis purchased 100 acres (0.40 km2) and several years later the streets of a town called Newport-Ayre were laid out. According to Newport histories, Justis saw the area's potential as a commercial crossroads and a port.
