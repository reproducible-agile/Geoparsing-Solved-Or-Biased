Nashville is a village in Barry County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,628 at the 2010 census. The township exists largely within Castleton Township, with a small portion extending south into Maple Grove Township. The initial plat for Nashville was on land originally purchased by John R. Pettibone on February 15, 1836. The land was part of Barry Township and then Hastings Township until February 16, 1842 when the land became Section 36 of the newly formed Castleton Township. By 1865, Robert B. Gregg owned the land and platted 127 lots on the south side of the Thornapple River. The survey was done by Joshua Martin and certified on October 2, 1865. Gregg's first lot sale was to Enos Kuhlman. By 1875, seven additions had been made to the original plat. In 1852, Henry Feighner and his brother Solomon arrived from Ohio seeking to buy land. In addition to 80 acres (320,000 m2) purchased from Horace Butler, Henry bought the property of Hiram Hanchett, including Hanchettâ€™s sawmill located on the west side of the Thornapple. Solomon managed the sawmill until Henry sold the property to Phillip Holler in about 1865.
