Hale is a small village and civil parish in Hampshire, England. It lies on the border of the New Forest, overlooking the valley of the River Avon. The village is about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-east of the town of Fordingbridge, and about 8 miles (13 km) south of the city of Salisbury. Within the parish stands Hale House, a large 18th-century mansion which was the country house of architect Thomas Archer, who also rebuilt Hale church in 1717. Hale is a village to the northeast of Fordingbridge in an area of woodland, to the east of the River Avon. It is a scattered community with some thatched cottages around the green, a village hall, and a Victorian school building which still houses the primary school. At the centre of the village is Hatchet Green, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Conservation Area. It contains various tree species including oak, ash, birch, holly, lawson cypress, chestnut and hawthorn. It was taken over by the Parish Council in 1975 because no owner could be traced.
