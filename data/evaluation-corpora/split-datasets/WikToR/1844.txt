Oka (Cayuga: Ganehsada:geh ) is a small Canadian city on the northern bank of the Ottawa River (Rivi√®re des Outaouais in French), northwest of Montreal, Quebec. Located in the Lower Laurentians on Lake of Two Mountains, where the Ottawa has its confluence with the St. Lawrence River, the town has a main thoroughfare that is now part of Quebec Route 344. This area was first settled by French colonists as a mission to First Nations in 1721 by brothers of the Sulpician Order branch of the Roman Catholic Church. Early native inhabitants were Mohawk (Kanienkaha), Algonquin, and Nipissing, who had a village known as Kanesatake, now a reserve within the boundaries of Oka. The area was inhabited for thousands of years by cultures of First Nations peoples. At the time of European contact, when Montreal was founded, the Mohawk Nation or Kanienkaha, one of the Five Nations of Iroquoian-speaking peoples based in upstate New York, used this territory as a hunting ground. The Sulpician Order established a Roman Catholic mission and trading post at what became the adjacent Kanesatake. Some Mohawk made this a new base; they were granted a nine-mile square portion of land by the French king in 1716 as he wanted to move them off the island of Montreal. The Sulpician Order was granted a narrow strip next to theirs. The Sulpicians arranged a change to the grant and deed without informing the Mohawk, gaining legal title to the land. The Mohawk protested, beginning in the late 18th century, but were never successful in regaining control of most of what they thought of as their land.
