Oviedo is a city in Seminole County, Florida, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 33,342, reflecting an increase of 7,026 (26.7%) from the 26,316 counted in the 2000 Census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the late 1870s, individuals living a couple miles south of Lake Jesup needed an easily accessible post office in the Florida back country. Andrew Aulin, an early settler and shop-owner, decided to file paperwork for a post office; in his first site location report he needed a unique name, one that no other post office in Florida had. Aulin liked having a Spanish name, "to go with the Spanish name of the state," and decided to name his post office location Oviedo after the city of Oviedo in northern Spain (the capital city of the Principality of Asturias) and the University of Oviedo. Some say he visited the University, others say he just liked the sound, most agree he likely pronounced it "Oh-vee-Ay-Doh" rather than the Americanized way of "Oh-VEE-doh."
