Pula (Latin: Nora) is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Cagliari in the Italian region of Sardinia, located about 25 kilometres (16 mi) southwest of Cagliari. As of December 31, 2004, it had a population of 6,937, and an area of 138.7 square kilometres (53.6 sq mi). Pula is a popular holiday resort, with many famous hotels and beaches. The ruins of the ancient city of Nora are among the most important archaeological sites of the island. The Municipality of Pula contains the frazione (subdivision) Santa Margherita di Pula. Pula is located near the ancient city of Nora. Nora was built by Phoenicians around the eighth century B.C. Pula may have arisen from pre-existing nuragic settlements, of which there are some testimonials, or according to the legend by the Iberians conducted in Sardinia by Norax. During the following centuries, the city was ruled by the Punics, and then by the Romans. The latter raised it for a short time in the capital of the province of Corsica et Sardinia, and then gave that title to the nearby Caralis (modern Cagliari). After the end of the Roman Empire, like many other ancient Sardinian coastal cities, because of the Saracen raids, the city of Nora ceased to exist from about the eighth century AD.
