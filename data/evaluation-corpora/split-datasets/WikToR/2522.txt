Kabul (Arabic: كابول‎, Hebrew: כָּבּוּל) is an Arab town in the North District of Israel, located 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) southeast of Acre and north of Shefa-'Amr. Fragments of pottery from the Persian period have been found in Kabul, as well as excavated burial chambers, used from the 1st to the 4th centuries. Kabul is probably the Biblical Cabul mentioned by Joshua. In Roman times, Josephus calls the town "Chabolo" and camped there. He described it as a post from which incursions were made into the Galilee. Potsherds dating from the end of the Hellenistic–Early Roman period, Roman, and Byzantine periods have been found. and bathhouse dating from the Byzantine era, and used well into the Umayyad era, have been excavated. Al-Muqaddasi visited Kabul in 985 CE, while it was under Abbasid rule. He writes that "it is a town in the coastal district. It has fields of sugarcanes, and they make the best sugar — better than in all the rest of Syria." Ali of Herat reports in 1173 that two sons of Jacob are buried in the town, namely Reuben and Simeon. Kabul was one of the principal cities of Jund al-Urrdun. Its Crusader name was "Cabor". In the 14th and 15th centuries, it was a place for Jewish pilgrimage for containing the tombs of the Jewish scholars and philosophers Abraham ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi.
