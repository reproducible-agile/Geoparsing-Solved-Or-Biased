Dundee is a town in the Northern Territory, Australia, located approximately 125 km (78 mi) southwest of Darwin on a peninsula between the Timor Sea and Bynoe Harbour. Dundee consists of three separate localities: Dundee Beach on the Timor Sea, Dundee Forest in the central peninsula and Dundee Downs adjacent to Bynoe Harbour in the east. The localities are named after the original subdivisions, believed to be in reference to the film "Crocodile" Dundee. The permanent population is estimated at approximately 400 residents. Development in the area began in the 1990s, originally as a weekend retreat for Darwin residents. The local economy is still largely dependent on tourism, with fishing being the main attraction. Community services and amenities include a small school established in 1998, a volunteer fire brigade and several sporting and social clubs. The town is situated in an unincorporated area with no local government; however, the possibility of Dundee's being included in an expanded Coomalie Shire has been raised in recent times. Currently, a volunteer progress association represents the interests of Dundee residents to the Northern Territory Government.
