Greenfield is a village in the Saddleworth parish of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham in Greater Manchester, England. It is 4 miles (6.4 km) east of Oldham, and 13 miles (21 km) east-northeast of the city of Manchester. It lies in a broad rural area amongst the South Pennines. To the east of the village Dovestone Reservoir, Chew Reservoir and Greenfield Reservoir lie within the Peak District National Park, though no part of the village itself lies within the Peak Park boundary. Lying within the ancient county boundaries of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Greenfield is mainly situated on and around two roads in the Chew Valley in the Pennines. One of these roads is the main A635 road from Ashton-under-Lyne to Holmfirth. A Roman road passes along the Saddleworth hills, from the fort of Ardotalia in Glossop to Castleshaw Roman fort. The route of the Roman road passes through Greenfield and crosses the Chew Brook at Packhorse Bridge. The old stone houses of Saddleworth date from the 17th century and were home to farmers and hand-loom weavers in the woollen trade. The first industrial looms were also designed and built in Saddleworth. England's highest church 'The Heights' and canal tunnel 'Standedge Tunnel' are also here, the latter dating from the end of the 18th century and being a Thomas Telford project.
