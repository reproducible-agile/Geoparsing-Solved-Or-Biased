Cumberland is a city in Barron County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 2,170 at the 2010 census. The city is located partially within the Town of Cumberland. It was incorporated in 1885. Cumberland is often called the “Island City” and the main part of the city, including the original settlement, is located on land surrounded by Beaver Dam Lake, originally settled by Chippewa Indian Tribe. Beaver Dam Lake was referred to as Che-wa-cum-ma-towangok or “Lake Made by the Beavers,” by the local tribe. The Chief of the Chippewa Tribe was Pon-gee Rau-gen, or “Little Pipe”. He continued to live in the area even after it was settled by European settlers and drowned in a canoe on Beaver Dam Lake in 1895. In 1874, A. Ritan and R. H. Clothier explored the area with the intention of settling in there. While exploring, they came across surveyors that informed them of the upcoming railroad line that the North Wisconsin Railway Company planned to lay in the area. A. Ritan, who lived near what is today Turtle Lake and the Dahlby Family, originally of Norwegian descent, from the town of New Richmond, both filed a homestead near the proposed railroad and built two log cabins, 300 feet north of the present high school location. In 1878, the North Wisconsin Railroad Company extended the rail lines through the area. Prior to the railroad, settlers were required to get provisions in Rice Lake, Barron or Clayton. In 1880, the Dahlby Family sold their cabin and moved to Chandler (now known as Spooner) and open a store. A. Ritan, also originally from Norway, lived in Cumberland for many years and helped develop the city before moving to Portland, Oregon.
