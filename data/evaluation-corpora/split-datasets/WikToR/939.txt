Springfield is the third largest city in the state of Missouri and the county seat of Greene County. According to the 2010 census data, the population was 159,498, an increase of 5.2% since the 2000 census. It is one of the two principal cities of the Springfield-Branson Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 537,631 and includes the counties of Christian, Dallas, Greene, Polk, Webster, Stone and Taney. Springfield's nickname is the "Queen City of the Ozarks" and is known as the "Birthplace of Route 66". It is also home of several universities including Missouri State University, Drury University, and Evangel University. The territory known as Missouri was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Soon after, the Delaware Native Americans received treaty land where Springfieldâ€™s Sequiota Park and the antique stores of its Galloway Village stand today. To the west, 500 Kickapoo Native Americans built wickiups on the prairie that still bears their name. Missouri became a state on August 10, 1821, and in 1833 the legislature designated most of the southern portion a single county. It was named for American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene, largely through a campaign by Springfield's founder, John Polk Campbell, to honor a man he admired. A Tennessee homesteader, Campbell announced his claim in 1829. Springfield was officially founded in 1830 and later incorporated in 1838.
