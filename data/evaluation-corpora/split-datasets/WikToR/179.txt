San Andres (also San Andres Bukid, bukid being the Tagalog for "farm" or "[rice] field") is a district of Manila, Philippines. San Andres shares its northeastern border with the districts of Santa Ana and Paco, while to its south lies Pasay and Makati. The area is under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Congressional District of Manila, and includes the Manila South Cemetery, an exclave of the city. Although San Andres only has a small land area, it is the second most densely populated district in Manila after Tondo. San Andres is divided into its eastern and western sectors by the Sergio Osme√±a Highway. Mostly residential, San Andres also has some sections classified as commercial. The majority of the district's population live just above the poverty line, mostly composed of post-World War II settlers from various provinces while the original inhabitants were middle or lower-class migrant families who had formerly settled in Tondo but found the rough working-class lifestyle less suitable for raising children. The influx of settlers into the district was unregulated, resulting in a lack of urban planning as evidenced by irregular buildings, narrow roadways, and large blocks of houses accessible only through metre-wide alleyways.
