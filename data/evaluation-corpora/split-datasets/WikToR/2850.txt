Charleston is a city in Mississippi County, Missouri, United States. The population was 5,947 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Mississippi County. It is a home to a local correctional facility. Charleston is the biggest town on the Missouri side near the confluence of the Mississippi River and Ohio River at Bird's Point, Missouri (11 miles east on U.S. Route 60). Its history has been tied to traffic on the rivers. Settlement initially occurred on the north side in what in 1805 was called Matthews Prairie. After purchasing 22.5 acres (91,000 m2) for $337, Joseph Moore laid out Charleston in 1837. It was named after Charleston, South Carolina. In 1845 it was selected the county seat. On September 1, 1861, Confederate General M. Jeff Thompson robbed the Union Bank of Charleston. Thompson, who handed the cashier a note, gave the cashier an hour to get approval from superiors to give him keys to the vault. After receiving the money, he left a receipt for $57,000 and discovered later that only $56,000 was in the bags.
