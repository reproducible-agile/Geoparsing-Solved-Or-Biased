Paris is a city in Paris Township, Edgar County, Illinois, 165 miles (266 km) south of Chicago and 90 miles (140 km) west of Indianapolis. In 1900, 6,105 people lived in Paris; in 1910, 7,664; and in 1940, 9,281. The population was 8,837 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Edgar County. Paris was established in 1826 on land donated by Samuel Vance to be the county seat, and was incorporated as a village in 1849. The town most likely received its name from the word "Paris" carved into a jack-oak tree in the middle of what would become the town. The history of Paris includes the service of two Booth brothers as Mayors of the town in the mid-1850s, Walter Booth and Newton Booth. Newton Booth later moved west to California where he served as Governor and eventually as a United States Senator. (source needed) The commission form of government was later adopted in 1915. In 1907 L. A. G. Shoaff bought the Centralia White Stockings and renamed them the Paris Colts. In 1908 the team was renamed the Paris Parisians. After the 1908 season the team went under. Paris was the home of a minor league baseball team in the 1950s named the Paris Lakers. A contest was held among the community to decide on a name for the team. The winning submission, Paris Lakers, was sent in by James C. Dickey. The Paris Lakers were the 1956 Midwest League Champions and were an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.
