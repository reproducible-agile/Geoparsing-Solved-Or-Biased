Bellingham is a tiny coastal hamlet in Northern Tasmania, situated on the mouth of the Pipers River directly opposite the town of Weymouth. The town is located 62 kilometres (39 mi) from Launceston, 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Bridport and 40 kilometres (25 mi) from George Town. At the 2006 census, Bellingham and the surrounding area had a population of 264. The township is largely made up of shacks used during the summer time. The permanent residence is about 25 people. In recent years the George Town Council has completed upgrade projects on many of the township's roads, including sealing works on the main Bellingham Road as well as base graveling on Gees Marsh Road, allowing better access to the central township and surrounding areas. There is a camping ground, tennis court and small boat ramp within the central township, The Marine and Safety Board of Tasmania (MAST) recently announcing funding for a much-needed upgrade for the ramp. the nearby shoreline of the Pipers River can easily be accessed from the town, as well as large coastal beaches adjacent to Bass Strait.
