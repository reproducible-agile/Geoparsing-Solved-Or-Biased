El Cajon (/ɛlkəˈhoʊn/; Spanish: [elkaˈxon]) is a city in San Diego County, California, United States. Nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains, the city has acquired the nickname of "The Big Box". Its name originated similarly, from the Spanish phrase "el cajón", which means "the box" or "the drawer." El Cajon, the Spanish words for "the big box", was first recorded on September 10, 1821, as an alternative name for sitio rancho Santa Mónica, describing the "boxed in" nature of the valley in which it sat. The name appeared on maps in 1873 and 1875 as shortened to just "Cajon" until the modern town developed where the post office was named "Elcajon." In 1905, the name was once again expanded to "El Cajon" when California banker and historian, Zoeth Skinner Eldredge, insisted that the words be separated. El Cajon is located at 32°47′54″N 116°57′36″W (32.798300, -116.960055). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.4 square miles (37 km2), all land. It is bordered by San Diego and La Mesa on the west, Spring Valley on the south, Santee on the north, and unincorporated San Diego County on the east. It includes the neighborhoods of Fletcher Hills, Bostonia, and Rancho San Diego.
