It is part of the rapidly growing Cape Region and lies within the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. Delaware Route 5 passes through Milton. Located at the head of the Broadkill River, Milton was first settled in 1672 by English Colonists. The town was known by various names until 1807, when it was named for the English poet, John Milton. The Delaware General Assembly passed the charter that recognized the Town of Milton as a municipality in 1945.

Many of the homes have been restored to their original form, particularly those on Union and Federal streets. Milton has 198 structures on the Federal Register Historic District and its history is preserved in the Lydia Black Cannon Museum, the Governor James Carey home, the Chestnut Street Cemetery, and the Governor David Hazzard Mansion.
