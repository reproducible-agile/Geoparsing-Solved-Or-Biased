Fuxin (Chinese: 阜新; pinyin: Fùxīn) is a prefecture-level city in northwestern Liaoning province, People's Republic of China. The total population of the prefecture at the 2010 census is 1,819,339, of whom 669,317 are resident in the built up area, which comprises four urban districts, collectively known as 'Fuxin City'. Fuxin has direct administration over 7 county-level divisions: 5 districts, 1 county and 1 autonomous county: Fuxin has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa), with long, cold but dry winters and hot, humid summers. A majority of the annual precipitation falls in July and August alone. Fuxin is a mining center in an agricultural region, producing mostly coal and agate. Fuxin is known as China's 'Agate City', with 50% of the nation's known deposits of the mineral being located there. The city also accounts for more than 90% of the country's agate products. The city suffers from the over-mining of coal, which is low in supply while fundamental to Fuxin's economy. As the coal mines run dry, Fuxin is trying to find other industries to keep its economy going. Measures taken have included the development of a part of the city as a 'Special Economic Zone', by which the city hopes to attract international investment.
