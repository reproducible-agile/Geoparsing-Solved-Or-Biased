Waterford is said to contain the only statue of George Washington wearing a British uniform, but in reality, he had been sent by the Governor of Virginia and is wearing the uniform of an officer in the Virginia Militia. In December 1753, at age 21, Washington was asked by Governor Dinwiddie to carry a British ultimatum to the French Canadians on the Ohio frontier. Washington delivered the message to the French Canadians at Fort Le Boeuf in present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French Canadians to abandon their development of the Ohio country to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, the Seven Years' War, or the French and Indian War.
