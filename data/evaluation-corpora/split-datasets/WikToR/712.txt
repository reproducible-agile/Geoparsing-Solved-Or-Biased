Weston is a village and civil parish in the English county of Suffolk located approximately 2 miles (3 km) south of Beccles in the District of Waveney. The parish lies either side of the A145 and is crossed by the Ipswich to Lowestoft railway line. Neighbouring villages include Ellough, Ringsfield, Willingham St Mary and Shadingfield. The village is largely dispersed with a mid-2005 population estimate for the parish of 230, measured at 257 in the 2011 Census. The village has few services and a joint parish council covers both Ringsfield and Weston. The village once had a school, on King's Lane, and a public house, the Duke of Marlborough on the main A145. Both are now closed and the major centre of population in the parish is to the west where it borders Ringsfield Corner. The parish church is medieval in origin and dedicated to St Peter. It has a primarily Norman core and is a Grade I listed building. The parish was combined with that of All Saints Church, Ellough in the 1970s. The village is named in the Domesday book as Westuna and formed part of the William the Conqueror's estate, with land also being held by Roger Bigot, Hugh de Montfort and Geoffrey de Mandeville. The village, which formed part of the Hundred of Wangford, had a population of around 30 families and paid around 2 geld in taxation.
