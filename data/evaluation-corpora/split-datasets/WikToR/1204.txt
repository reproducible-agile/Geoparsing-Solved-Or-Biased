It was formerly known as Nagpartian and was renamed after the martyred priest José Burgos who was born in the Ilocos Region. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 9,687 people. The town was first known as Nagparitan, the early inhabitants were called Mumburi and known as a wild and fierce people who prevented the Christianized natives from settling in the vicinity. When the Spaniards came to the area, the people staged a revolt, captured the priest and mutilated his body. Because of this incident, the Spaniards change the name of Nagparitan, meaning prohibit, to Nagpartian which means the place of slaughter. In 1903, Nagpartian was then fused with the Municipality of Bangui because of the unstable condition due to low collection of government taxes. On February 28, 1914, by virtue of a legislative act, Nagpartian was renamed Burgos in honor of one of the three martyred priest, Fr, Jose Burgos. Seńor Juan Ignacio was the first Presidente Municipal of the town.
