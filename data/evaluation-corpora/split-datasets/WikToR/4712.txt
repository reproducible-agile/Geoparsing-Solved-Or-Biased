Mogo (postcode: 2536) is a small heritage town in the South Coast region of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Mogo is administered by the Eurobodalla Shire council. The town is located on the Princes Highway (Highway 1), south of Batemans Bay and north of Moruya. At the 2011 census, Mogo had a population of 263 people. Mogo was established during the Gold Rush after a gold find was reported in 1851. Bimbimbie, the last gold mine in the Mogo area, closed in 1984 with the floating of the Australian dollar. The town survived as a sleepy highway town, and during the 1990s was revitalised with the growth in regional tourism. Mogo is now home to a variety of tourist-centric stores including cafes, art galleries, potters, and furniture stores. Mogo is also a centre for the Aboriginal population of the area. Mogo is home to the Mogo Zoo, a private zoo specializing in breeding programs for endangered species. Although small in comparison to metropolitan zoos, Mogo Zoo is home to many exotic species, such as the red panda and the snow leopard, the latter of which was successfully bred at Mogo Zoo in 1999. Mogo Zoo also participates in programs with other Australian zoos, and its collection of animals changes regularly.
