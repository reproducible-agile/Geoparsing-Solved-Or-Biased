Newport is a residential suburb of the Moreton Bay Region at the north of the Redcliffe peninsula, approximately 29 kilometres (18 mi) north-northeast of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. The suburb of Newport was gazetted as the Place Name Decision Notice (No 21) 2008 in the Queensland Government Gazette â€“ Natural Resources and Water on August 15, 2008 (2008-08-15), after a submission by the then Redcliffe City Council to the Queensland Government Department of Natural Resources and Water in October 2006. An earlier, unsuccessful attempt by the council to create the suburb was made in the 1990s. Until 2008, Newport was made up of two areas - with that east of Albatross & Walkers Creek Canal being Scarborough, and that on the western side being part of Kippa-Ring. Currently, new land is being cleared and canals being dug out to form the next stage of the suburb to the west of the current established area. The name Newport comes from the Newport Waterways housing estate that began development in the late 1970s; the artificial canals first filled with water in 1979.
