Kobo is a town in northern Wollo Ethiopia. Located in the Semien Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region, this town has a longitude and latitude of 12°09′N 39°38′E with an elevation of 1468 meters above sea level. It is the administrative center of Kobo woreda. Kobo is located on the Addis Ababa-Adigrat highway (Ethiopian Highway 1), 189 kilometers south of Mekele. A road from Kobo west to Lalibela has existed since the 1930s, but as of 1999, it is usable only in good weather by four-wheel vehicles. Kobo is part of a mid-altitude area which lies between the Ethiopian Highlands to the west and the Afar Depression to the east. The northern portion of this area is known as Raya. Raya is a flat plain which extends north from Kobo woreda into the Raya Azebo woreda in Tigray. Similar areas exist on the eastern edges of Yejju, Wollo, and Shewa further south. This area has been involved in disputes between the Christian highlanders and Muslims from the east since the time of the Ifat Sultanate (13th century). Much of the early conflict took place further south on the eastern border of what is now Shewa. However, in the 16th century, the Raya area was the site of an important conflict in Ethiopian history between the armies of the General of Adal, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, known better amongst Ethiopians as Imam Ahmed Gragn, and the Abyssinian forces of Lebna Dengel. This infamous period of conflict was known as the Ethiopian-Adal War. The Ethiopians were forced to ask for help from the Portuguese who arrived at port of Massawa on February 10, 1541. In April of 1542 the two armies met north of Lake Ashenge (near Korem in Tigray). This marked the first use of fire arms by the Abyssinian military.
