The Cache Creek post office opened in 1852, moved and changed its name to Madison in 1877. The name was bestowed by Daniel Bradley Hulbert after his hometown, Madison, Wisconsin. The townsite was laid out and named "Madison" in 1877 when the railroad, the Vaca Valley and Clear Lake Railroad, reached that spot, as the terminus, after expanding north from Winters. The Cache Creek Post Office had been located in the settlement of Cottonwood, approximately one mile south of Madison. Many of Cottonwood's structures were then moved to Madison, as Cottonwood did not have a railroad stop. The 2010 United States Census reported that Madison had a population of 503.
