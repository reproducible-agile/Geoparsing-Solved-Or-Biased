Scranton is a ghost town in Tooele County, Utah, United States. Located in Barlow Canyon near the Juab County line, it was a short-lived mining town. Scranton has been uninhabited for nearly a century, but some of its ruins have survived relatively intact. Scranton was founded in 1908 around the New Bullion Mine, a lead and zinc mine. It was part of the North Tintic Mining District, organized in 1902 for the area's silver, lead, and zinc mines. The new town became the home of the Scranton Mining and Smelting Company, the owners naming it after Scranton, Pennsylvania, their home town. Some 90 miners lived in Scranton, a few with families. The town included homes, a boarding house, general store/post office, and assay office. The large pocket of good ore at the New Bullion lasted only about two years, and the town began to dwindle. Then in October 1914 a new company called the South Scranton was organized, and miners dug a long tunnel in search of other mineral resources. During World War I Scranton produced tungsten, sending it by insured parcel post due to its scarcity. After the war the town quickly emptied.
