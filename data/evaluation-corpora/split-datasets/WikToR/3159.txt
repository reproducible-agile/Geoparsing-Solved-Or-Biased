Baga is a town in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borno, close to Lake Chad, and lying northeast of the town of Kukawa. It is located within the Kukawa Local Government Area. The town is approximately 196km from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State. The "Doron Baga" fish market, as of 2000, was located about six kilometres from the town. Baga used to lie on the border of Lake Chad and was a fishing center itself in the 1960s and 1970s, but the diminishing size of the lake has caused fishermen to move, and others have turned to subsistence farming. In April 2013, over 185 people were killed and over 2000 homes in Baga were destroyed as a result of fighting between the Nigerian military and the Boko Haram Islamist group. In January 2015, Boko Haram again attacked the town, seizing it and the military base used by a multinational force set up to fight them. The town was burned and the people massacred — perhaps 2000 deaths — the largest such massacre in Boko Haram's history. Some residents escaped to nearby Chad.
