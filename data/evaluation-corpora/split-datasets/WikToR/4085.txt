Chail is a hill station in Himachal Pradesh, India. Chail is 44 km from Shimla and 45 km from Solan. The Chail Palace is well known for its architecture, the palace was built as summer retreat by the Maharaja of Patiala during the British Raj, on the land allotted to him by the British for former's assistance in the Anglo-Nepalese War. The cricket ground and a polo ground which is there at an altitude of 2,250 m was owned by erstwhile royal family of Patiala. It is the world's highest cricket ground. Chail is also considered as the hiker's paradise. The area is away from the bustling life of the state capital Shimla. In 1891, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala incurred the rage of Lord Kitchener. It led to the restriction of his entry in the Indian summer capital, Shimla. This incensed the Maharaja and he vowed to build a new summer retreat for himself. So he rebuilt the place (Chail) as per his requirements. After accession to the Indian Union, Maharaja of Patiala donated most of his buildings to Chail Military School and Government of India.
