Brewster is a village in, and the county seat of, Blaine County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 17 at the 2010 census. The town was laid out in 1884 by George Washington Brewster who had homesteaded the land there. It was named for one of his ancestors, William Brewster, who had arrived in America on the Mayflower. The community was named the county seat in 1887 after George Washington Brewster offered to build the required buildings. According to town lore, Brewster had expected the state capitol to be located in the community because of its central location. In 1887 the outlaw D.C."Doc" Middleton opened a saloon in the community.
