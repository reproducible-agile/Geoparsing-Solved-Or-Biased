Taoyuan (Chinese: 桃園市; pinyin: Táoyuán Shì), is a special municipality in northwestern Taiwan, neighboring New Taipei, Hsinchu County, and Yilan County. Taoyuan District is the seat of the municipal government and that which, along with Zhongli District, forms a large metropolitan area, home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. Taoyuan developed from a satellite city of Taipei metropolitan area to be the fourth-largest metropolitan area, and fifth-largest populated city in Taiwan. Since commuting to the Taipei metropolitan area is easy, Taoyuan has seen the fastest population growth of all cities in Taiwan. "Taoyuan" means "peach garden," since the area used to have many peach blossom trees. Taoyuan is the native home to the Pingpu tribe of aborigines. It is also one of Taiwan's important industrial regions. Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, which serves the capital, Taipei and the rest of northern Taiwan, is located in this city. The current city of Taoyuan achieved its current form in 2014 when the former Taoyuan County was elevated to special municipality status. At the same time, the original county-controlled city of Taoyuan became Taoyuan District within the new municipality.
