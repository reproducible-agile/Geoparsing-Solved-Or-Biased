China is an unincorporated community in Shelby Township, Jefferson County, Indiana. It spans Shelby and Madison Townships and was for years largely defined by the existence of a general store in Madison Township and the former St. Anthony's Catholic Church in Shelby township. Razor's Fork runs between the two sections. Indiana State Road 62 runs parallel to Razor's Fork in Madison Township, and then crosses the stream and heads north to Canaan. The origin of the name is not known. In her history of St. Anthony's Church, area resident Elma Schafer related a story, which she said was confirmed by Catholic priests, that China stemmed from the name of Father Munnschina, a priest. In the late 1960s, Mrs. Frances Ringwald, whose daughter Edith and son William "Bud" Thomas, operated the China store, said she was told that the site had mulberry trees, which suggested silk, which suggested China. However, China post office opened on January 30, 1833 and closed on November 29, 1838, years before the arrival of the German Catholics who founded St. Anthony's and who were served by Munnschina. The first China postmaster was Moses Wilder, a Presbyterian minister who had arrived in nearby Madison by 1830, as an agent of the American Tract Society.
