Sandala (Arabic: صندله‎; Hebrew: צַנְדַלָה, סַנְדַלָה) is an Arab village in the North District of Israel. Located near Afula, it falls under the jurisdiction of Gilboa Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 1,500. According to a local tradition, the present village was (re-)established in the 18th-century in the Ottoman era by two brothers from the nearby village Arranah, which is today part of the West Bank. When Edward Robinson passed by Sandala in 1838, he described it as a "small site of ruined foundations," while Victor Guérin, who passed by in 1870, noted it as "a hamlet, situated on a mound." In 1882 the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described it as a "small village on the edge of the plain, built of stone and mud, supplied by cisterns, and surrounded by plough-land." In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sandala had a population of 146, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 189, still all Muslim, in a total of 36 houses.
