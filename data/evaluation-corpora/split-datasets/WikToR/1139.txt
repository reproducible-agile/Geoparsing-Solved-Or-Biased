The hall was constructed of stone from Ayliffeâ€™s quarry in the Adelaide Hills laid on concrete foundations. It was used as the civic centre of the City of Brighton from 1869 until 1936 when it was then leased by the RSL. Brighton was the home of Australian geologist, Antarctic explorer and academic Sir Douglas Mawson. He was buried at Saint Jude's Anglican church in the town.
