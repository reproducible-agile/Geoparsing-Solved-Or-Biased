Princeton is a ghost town located in Washington County, Mississippi, United States. Once a busy port on the Mississippi River, Princeton today is covered by forest and a portion of the Mississippi Levee. Nothing remains of the settlement. Princeton was named for William Berry Prince, who settled on nearby Lake Jackson with his wife Sarah S. Jefferies in the early 1820s. Princeton was one of the first towns in the Mississippi Delta. In 1830, Princeton became Washington County's second county seat after the first county seat, New Mexico, caved into the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River flowed directly west of Princeton, and "Princeton Landing" was the town's port. Across the river in Arkansas was the now-extinct town of "Grand Lake". The Mississippi Legislature incorporated the "Lake Washington and Deer Creek Railroad and Banking Company" in 1836. Based in Princeton, the railroad began constructing a line east from the town to Lake Washington and Deer Creek. The intent was to move cotton by railroad to Princeton, where it could be shipped by boat along the Mississippi River. Only a portion of the railroad bed was completed before the company's charter was repealed in 1839.
