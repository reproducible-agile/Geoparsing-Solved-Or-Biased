Buffalo is a city in Johnson County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 4,585 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Johnson County. In recent years, the town has boomed economically due to methane production from the coal bed methane extraction method used in the Powder River Basin and surrounding areas.Even though energy is a vital part of its economy, agriculture and tourism are two other major components. Buffalo is located at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains, so recreation is a short distance away. Many generational ranchers still run cattle and sheep over the highly productive terrain. The Wyoming Department of Health Veteran's Home of Wyoming, an assisted living facility for veterans and their dependents, is located in Buffalo. The facility was operated by the Wyoming Board of Charities and Reform until that agency was dissolved as a result of a state constitutional amendment passed in November 1990. Buffalo also has an airport named Johnson County Airport/KBYG. Public education in the city of Buffalo is provided by Johnson County School District #1. Schools serving the city include Meadowlark Elementary School (grades K-2) Cloud Peak Elementary School (grades 3–5), Clear Creek Middle School (grades 6–8), and Buffalo High School (grades 9–12). Buffalo High School was in the national news spot light after the (former) head football coach, distributed an offensive "hurt feelings report" in November 2011. This attention brought several heated school board meetings and eventually lead to the resignation of Lynch as the head football coach.
