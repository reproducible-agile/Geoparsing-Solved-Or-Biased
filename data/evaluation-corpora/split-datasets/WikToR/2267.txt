Lincoln County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,720. Its county seat is Hamlin. The county was created in 1867 and named for Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln County is part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Charleston-Huntington-Ashland, WV-OH-KY Combined Statistical Area. The county is probably best known as the birthplace of Chuck Yeager. Lincoln County was created by an act of the West Virginia Legislature on February 23, 1867, from parts of Boone, Cabell, Kanawha and Putnam counties. By 1869, the county had returned much of its Putnam County territory and absorbed the northern portion of Logan County and a portion of Wayne County. In 1869, Harts Creek Township (later district) was created from this latter region. Lincoln County is one of five counties created by West Virginia since the Civil War. Hamlin, seat of government for the county, was established in 1853. Jesse, John, David, William, and Moses McComas were the first Anglo settlers in what is now Lincoln County. They cultivated 20 acres (81,000 m2) of corn, the first ever grown in the area near present-day West Hamlin, in 1799. Later that year, they returned to eastern Virginia to get their families. Their families were initially left behind because it was not known if there were any hostile Native Americans in the area, or if the soil would be suitable for cultivation. John Lucas, William Hinch, and John Johnson soon joined the McComases in the county. They built cabins in the county around 1800. About 1804, William Wirt Brumfield settled at the mouth of Big Ugly Creek.
