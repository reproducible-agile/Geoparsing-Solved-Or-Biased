Dolo is a town in southeastern Ethiopia, within 30 kilometers of the Ethiopia-Somalia border. Located in the Liben Zone of the Somali Region, this town has a latitude and longitude of 04°10′N 42°04′E. The Mena River flows to the northeast. When a delegation from the UNDP visited the town in February 1994, they reported that an elementary school was present, but not functioning because of a "lack of basic school materials and lack of budget for teachers salary". One of the earliest recorded mentions of Dolo was during Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis's campaign against the Borana, when he reached as far as Dolo in 1896-1897 and founded military garrisons in the region. Dolo was one of the markets on the trade route that stretched from Bardera through Luuq (in modern-day Somalia) to Ginir. Marshal Rodolfo Graziani started his attack in the Second Italian-Abyssinian War on 4 October 1935 and soon occupied Dolo. He began his major large attack northwards on 10 January 1936. In March 1941, during World War II. the 1st Battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment caught the 20th Brigade of the Italian 101st Colonial Division at Dolo; its commander, staff and 3,000 men surrendered after negligible resistance.
