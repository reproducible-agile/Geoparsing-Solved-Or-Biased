Winton is a town in Central West Queensland, Australia, 177 kilometres (110 mi) northwest of Longreach. The main industries of the area are sheep and cattle raising. The town was named in 1876 by postmaster Robert Allen, after his place of birth, Winton, Dorset. At the 2011 census, Winton had a population of 954. In 2015 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that recent seismic studies indicated that 300 million years ago an asteroid or comet struck the area releasing energy equivalent to 650 Hiroshima A-bombs. Richard Blewett, a senior official with Geoscience Australia, described how it was a long circular arc in the course of the Diamantina River near Winton that triggered the curiosity that prompted seismic studies. The strike left geomagnetic anomalies over an area 130 kilometres (81 mi) in diameter. The area surrounding the town has yielded a number of dinosaur fossils, including 'Elliot', a sauropod. In 2009, three dinosaur genera, Australovenator, Wintonotitan and Diamantinasaurus, were discovered near the town. Australovenator wintonensis, the type specimen of that genus, is named after the town. The town also lent its name to the Winton Formation.
