Houston is a city in Houston County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 979 at the 2010 census. The community was named after Sam Houston, first president of the Republic of Texas. In 1852, William McSpadden platted the original site of the Village of Houston. McSpadden had served under Sam Houston in the Mexican-American War. Pioneers followed him into the area and by 1854 there were stores and a school among the approximately 40 buildings in the settlement. Houston was incorporated in 1874. "Houston Hoedown Days" is the last full weekend in July. The event includes tractor pulls, the Minnesota State Horsepull, dances and flea markets. The "International Festival of Owls" is held each year in Houston, and is the only full-weekend, all-owl event in North America. Houston is the eastern terminus of the Root River segment of the Blufflands State Trail. In November 2008 the Houston Hurricanes won the Minnesota 9-Man Football State Championship. They ended their season with a 14-0 mark. This is the first State Championship in school history, with the exception of five state appearances by the girls track teamâ€”which included a state title in 2006.
