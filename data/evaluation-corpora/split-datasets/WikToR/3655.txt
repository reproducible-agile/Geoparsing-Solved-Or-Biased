Additional tracks have been recognized nearby, within the villages of Arhab and Bait al Washr. At the main site it was determined that there were tracks of eleven sauropods and one ornithopod dating from 150 million years ago. Footprints of both juveniles and adults were found.

The discovery has since been signposted for tourists, and efforts are underway to list the site with UNESCO. From here, migrated to various parts of kerala is known as the name of the family madari.
