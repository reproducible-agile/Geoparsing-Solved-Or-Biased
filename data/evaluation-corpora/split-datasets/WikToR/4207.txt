Ramsgate is in the local government area of the City of Rockdale. Ramsgate Beach is a separate suburb, to the east. Ramsgate is surrounded by the suburbs of Ramsgate Beach, Monterey, Kogarah, Beverley Park and Sans Souci. The area between Cooks River and Georges River was originally known as Seven Mile Beach. It was changed to Lady Robinsonâ€™s Beach in 1874 to honour the wife of Governor Sir Hercules Robinson. Cook Park is named after Samuel Cook who advocated it as a public pleasure area. Ramsgate was named after the seaside resort in England. A model village was originally planned for the suburb but later abandoned. Scarborough Park was created in the 1830s from part of Pat Moore's Swamp or Patmore Swamp. Patrick Moore was granted 60 acres (240,000 m2) of land in 1812. It was named by the Hon. Thomas Holt after the English coastal town of Scarborough, Yorkshire and the First Fleet convict ship which was briefly anchored in Botany Bay in 1788.
