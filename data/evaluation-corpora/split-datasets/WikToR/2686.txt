Norwich is a city in Chenango County, New York, United States. Surrounded on all sides by the town of Norwich, the city is the county seat of Chenango County. The name is taken from Norwich, England. Its population was 7,190 at the 2010 census. Lt. Warren Eaton Airport (OIC), serving the area, is located north of the city in the town of North Norwich. The first settlers arrived around 1788. The town of Norwich was formed in 1793 from the towns of Union (now in Broome County) and Bainbridge. Afterwards, Norwich, as a "mother town" of the county, lost substantial territory in the formation of new towns. In 1806, Norwich gave up territory to form the towns of Pharsalia, Plymouth and Preston. More of Norwich was lost in 1807 to form parts of the towns of New Berlin and Columbus. In 1808 and 1820, Norwich exchanged territory with the town of Preston. The central community of Norwich set itself off from the town in 1816 by incorporating as a village, later becoming the city of Norwich in 1914.
