Santiago is a fourth class municipality in the province of Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 17,958 people. Santiago Cove is dubbed as the "Boracay of Ilocos Sur" because of its white sands. Santiago is the headquarters of the Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative (ISECO), which distributes electricity to the entire province. Santiago is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. Before the Spanish Conquest of the Philippines, Moro raiders were in control, so one of the tasks of the Spanish was to pacify and clear the country of these pirates. Coastal communities (Northern Luzon, and, thus, Ilocos) were prone to piratical attacks. For these, watchtowers were erected all over the Ilocos coast. The Spanish started patrols of sea lanes, stopping these pirates for a while, only for them to resurface in 1772. But in the place now known as Santiago, as the Spanish engaged the pirates, all church bells ringing and trumpets sounded (to signal their attacks), the Augustinians stationed in the place held a statue of Santiago (Saint James) facing the sea and with many natives praying the rosary for safety and victory. The Moros fled, never to return, thus sparing the pueblo. The place was since then named Santiago.
