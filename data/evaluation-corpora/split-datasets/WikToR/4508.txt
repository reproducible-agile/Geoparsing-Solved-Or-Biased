Rock Island is an unincorporated community in the northeastern-most portion of Warren County, Tennessee, United States. The town is named after an island on the Caney Fork River just below the confluence of the Rocky River. Rock Island is home to the Great Falls Dam and Rock Island State Park. Many different houses, restaurants, and marinas can be found here. Rock Island is a popular destination during the summer season. It is known for scenic waterfalls and bluffs. Boats can often be seen on the river riding by. The state park offers many different hiking trails as well as a sand bar (almost a beach front).

This path later became the Old Kentucky Road, which roughly parallels the modern State Route 136. Another trail, known as the Black Fox Trail, passed east-to-west just south of Rock Island. In 1793, in the latter part of the Cherokeeâ€“American wars, a skirmish was fought at Rock Island between a small contingent of soldiers pursuing several Chickamaugas, who had reportedly stolen horses. The Tennessee historian J.G.M. Ramsey reported:
