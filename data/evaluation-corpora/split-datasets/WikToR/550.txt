Hastings is a town in Jefferson County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 143 at the 2010 census, a decline from 155 at the 2000 census. A community called Bayard existed at the site of present-day Hastings until the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Reservation was opened to new settlers on August 6, 1901. Since Indian Territory already had a post office named Baird, the postal department named the station it established at this location. A couple of residents had suggested naming it for their home town of Hastings, Nebraska. That was accepted by postal officials. In 1902, a railroad line called Enid and Anadarko built tracks through Hastings. The population was 560 in 1907 and 727 in 1910. The population has declined continuously from 1910 until the present. Hastings is located at 34°13'39"N, 98°6'31"W. It is 9 miles (14 km) northwest of Waurika and 5 miles (8.0 km) north of the Red River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2), all of it land.
