Loka (pronounced [ˈloːka]; Italian: Lonche) is a small village in the City Municipality of Koper in the Littoral region of Slovenia. The toponym Loka is relatively common in Slovenia. It is derived from the Slovene noun loka 'swampy meadow', from Proto-Slavic *lǫka 'swampy, flood-prone meadow', semantically derived from 'meander'. Toponyms of the same origin are also found in other Slavic countries (e.g., Polish Łąka, Serbian Luka, Bulgarian Shiroka Laka, etc.) The Italian name Lonche reflects the early Slavic nasal vowel. During the Second World War, from March to September 1943 the first regional committee of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation was headquartered at the house of Ivan Žigante (a.k.a. Peter) in the hamlet of Žgani. Loka was burned by German forces on 12 October 1943. The local church is dedicated to Saint Cecilia and belongs to the Parish of Predloka. The medieval church was burned by German forces on 12 October 1943 and its ruins were registered as cultural heritage. The parish archive, which had been transferred from Predloka to Loka for safekeeping, was also destroyed in the fire. The church was rebuilt by the villagers in 2005.
