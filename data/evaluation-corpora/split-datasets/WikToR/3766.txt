Johnsonville is a city in Florence County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 1,418 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Florence Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city was founded in 1913 above the spot of the former Witherspoon's Ferry, where General Francis Marion received his commission for the Revolutionary War. J. Stevens Dukes has served as mayor since 2004. Johnsonville is also home to the Heritage Festival, which began in 2011 to celebrate the area's ties to the American Revolution. In use during the American Revolution, Witherspoon's Ferry was the site where Francis Marion accepted command of the Williamsburg Militia in 1780. Ownership of the ferry lands passed from Robert to John Witherspoon in 1787. In 1802, John bequeathed the land to Aimwell Presbyterian Church. Witherspoon's Ferry was a strategic ferry in the northeastern area of Williamsburg County, vested in John Witherspoon in 1801 and remaining in his charge until his death in 1815. According to the terms of John Witherspoon’s will, the ferry was then vested in J. D. Witherspoon, executor, for a term of 14 years, “in trust for and having the sole benefit of the incorporated Presbyterian Church at Aimwell on the Pee Dee River."
