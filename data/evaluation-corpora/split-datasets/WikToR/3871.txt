Soo (曽於市, Soo-shi) is a city located in northeastern Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is near Miyakonojō, Miyazaki. As of 2011, the city has an estimated population of 38,647 and a population density of 99 persons per km². This is down from the 2006 population data, which was an estimated population of 43,752 and a population density of 112 persons per km². The total area is 390.39 km². Soo is one of the many small cities in Japan that have a steadily decreasing population. Much of Soo is mountainous and covered with forest. It rains, but it rarely snows. Soo is located in Kagoshima so it also receives ash from its volcanoes, most notably: Shinmoedake and Sakurajima. Soo is a land-locked city and is in middle of the Osumi Peninsula. The modern city of Soo was established on July 1, 2005, from the merger of the towns of Ōsumi (Iwagawa), Sueyoshi and Takarabe (all from Soo District). All of Soo had a train system, but due to low use most of it was torn out and paved into a running path. There are three small un-manned train stations in Takarabe (Northern Soo) that connect to trains going to Miyazaki Prefecture and to Kagoshima City. They are: Takarabe Station, Kitamata Station, and Osumi-Okawara Station
