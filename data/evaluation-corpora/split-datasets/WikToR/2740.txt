Panama is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,413 at the 2010 census. This town began as a coal mining community named Red Town because all of the miners' shacks were painted red. The origin of the town name is uncertain. Some historians claim that the name was inspired by the building of the Panama Canal, but the town was already called Panama by 1898. The site for the canal was not selected until 1902, so this claim seems unfounded. In 1896 the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (acquired by the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1900) built a north-south line through the region. The Midland Valley Railroad built an east-west line through the region in 1903-1904. The town of Panama moved to the crossing of the two railroads. The Panama post office first opened January 14, 1898, but the order was rescinded for some unknown reason on February 23, 1898. The post office reopened February 21, 1899.
