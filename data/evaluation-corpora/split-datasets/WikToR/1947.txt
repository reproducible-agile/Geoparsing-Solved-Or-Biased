Yalu is a large village in the Markham Valley of Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. It lies along the Highlands Highway 21.5 kilometres (13.4 mi) north-west of Lae, 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) southeast of Nadzab. The landscape is typically lowland rainforest. In 1930, a delegation including the District Officer and Patrol Officer (Kiap based around Nadzab, inspected Markham Valley villages. The report to the Council of the League of Nations states: "The Yalu natives had recently abandoned their old village, and have established themselves nearby in a more accessible position. I inspected the village and saw 120 natives, none had complaints" During World War 2, Number 3 Platoon, 2/1 Forestry Company, Royal Australian Engineers established a forestry camp at Yalu to provide timber and the New Guinea RAAF Training School was located in and around Yalu. In 2008, three weeks of rain recorded at 107mm for a 24-hour period has led to extensive flooding in Papua New Guinea's Morobe province with the Yalu bridge connecting the province and the highlands on the verge of collapsing. Many farms and homes in Yalu have been washed away.
