Newcastle is a community in the Municipality of Clarington in Durham Region, Ontario, Canada. The Town of Newcastle was also the original name of what is now Clarington. Newcastle is located about 80 km east of Toronto, and about 18 km east of Oshawa and Bowmanville on Highway 401. It is also the southern terminus of Highway 35 and Highway 115. Newcastle was incorporated as a town in 1856. It remained a small community until the 1990s, when new residential development began and the population quickly swelled. Newcastle had a jail in the late 1800s. Maps of Newcastle from those years have not been discovered. Many have tried to find the location of this jail; however, it is believed that it was either demolished or had been destroyed by the elements. There are jail cells in the Newcastle Community Hall. Newcastle is filled and surrounded by agriculture farms raising cattle, pigs, apples, grain, and corn. Newcastle has a beautiful community hall, donated by the Massey family, one public high school (Clarke), one public elementary school (Newcastle Public School), one Catholic elementary school (St. Francis of Assisi), a post office, churches, a few plazas, several small parks, six restaurants, Tim Hortons, a new recreation complex, an ice arena, fire hall, two grocery stores, professional offices, hardware stores, a marina on Lake Ontario, and a golf course (Newcastle Golf Course).
