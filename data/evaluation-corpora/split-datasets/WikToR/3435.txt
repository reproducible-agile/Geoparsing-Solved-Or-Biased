Minden bills itself as "Nebraska's Christmas City", illuminating the courthouse square with a display of over 12,000 bulbs and staging an annual Christmas pageant titled "The Light Of The World". The lighting of the courthouse was begun in 1915, when lights were acquired with the intention of stringing them from the railroad station to the town square for the state G.A.R. convention. Weather precluded this use, and the lights were repurposed for a Christmas display.
