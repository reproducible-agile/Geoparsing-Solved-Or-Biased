Brod (Serbian Cyrillic: Брод; Bosnian: Bosanski Brod, pronounced [bǒsanskiː brôːd]) is a town and municipality located on the south bank of the river Sava in the northern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated in the northwestern part of the Republika Srpska entity and the western part of the Posavina region. Prior to the Bosnian War of the 1990s, it was Bosanski Brod. After the war the official name is only Brod. In May 2009, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska removed the prefix Bosanski resulting in the name Brod. Today its official name is just Brod, without the prefix Bosanski or Srpski. The Croatian town of Slavonski Brod is situated on the opposite (northern) bank of the Sava forming a built-up area of more than 110,000 inhabitants. The bridge over the Sava River at Brod was one of the few between Croatia and Bosnia not to be destroyed; it was reinforced by NATO, using troops of the U.S. 10th Mountain Division, to keep open a link between the two countries. • Brod • Brusnica Mala • Brusnica Velika • Donja Barica • Donja Močila • Donja Vrela • Donje Kolibe • Donji Klakar • Gornja Barica • Gornja Močila • Gornja Vrela • Gornje Kolibe • Gornji Klakar • Grk • Koraće • Kričanovo • Kruščik • Liješće • Novo Selo • Sijekovac • Unka • Vinska i Zborište.
