The suburb has boundaries of Main North Road to the East; Carter Street, Audley Avenue and Avenue Road to the South; The Gawler railway line on the west and a line 400m north of Regency Road (Livingstone Avenue, Angwin Avenue and Henrietta Street) on the north. The suburb features many Victorian era houses, and some stately 19th century mansions, although not as grand as those on Fitzroy Terrace. The suburb is very appealing to those who want to live near the city, but not in such busy suburbs as North Adelaide and in the CBD. The Prospect Road Fashion Food and Wine Affair is hosted annually by the City of Prospect. This event allows local traders to showcase their goods and service in the wider community. This event is generally held on the 2nd Sunday in November. The City of Prospect was named as such because it area was seen as a "beautiful prospect" by the gazeteer in 1838. In 1944 the city council voted to adopt the same name for the suburb of Prospect.
