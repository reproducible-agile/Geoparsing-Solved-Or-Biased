South Missouri and the town of Stockton are often referred to culturally and geographically by many as "Where the South Begins" because of its laid back southern lifestyle that culturally and geographically seems to have more in common with (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina) than it does the rest of Missouri which carries a more industrial cornbelt feel that is found in the true Midwest. The town is surrounded by rolling hills, rocky terrain, winding rivers, pristine lakes, cattle ranches, and heavily forested woods. Stockton's original settlers came into the area from the coastal Southeast and Deep South regions of the country. This history gives the town and region its own unique flair in fulfilling their role in the extreme cultural and geographical diversity of the "Show-Me-State".
