Carmel /ˈkɑːrməl/ is a suburban city in Hamilton County, Indiana, United States located immediately north of Indianapolis. It has been one of the fastest-growing communities in the country. In 2012, Carmel was selected the Best Place to Live in United States by CNN Money magazine. The population was 85,927 at the 2013 census, making it the fifth-largest city in Indiana. Carmel was originally called Bethlehem and, under the latter name, was laid out and platted in 1837. The original settlers were predominantly Quakers. Today, the plot first established in Bethlehem, located at the intersection of Rangeline Road and Main Street, is marked by a clock tower, donated by the local Rotary Club in 2002. A post office was established as Carmel in 1846. The town of Bethlehem was renamed Carmel in 1874, at which time it was incorporated. In 1924, one of the first automatic traffic signals in the U.S. was installed at the intersection of Main Street and Rangeline Road. The signal was the invention of Leslie Haines and is currently in the old train station on the Monon Trail.
