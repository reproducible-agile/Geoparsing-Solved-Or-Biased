Rosario is 215 kilometres (134 mi) away from Metro Manila. Rosario links Ilocos and Cordillera Provinces. The flight distance between Manila and Rosario is 189 km. Rosario came from the phrase “rosas del rio” (beautiful landscape with narrow valleys, wild animals, birds, rivers, brooks, dense forest and riverscape, as discovered by Spaniards). Another version or story, is that the long range of foothill far west of the Poblacion appearing like big Rosary beads was source of the town's name (giant and long rocky rosary). Rosario is the southernmost town of La Union and the Ilocos Region, hence called the “Gateway to Ilocandia”. Rosario's national highway passes along a mountain at barangay Agat (of Sison, Pangasinan), then into the Bued bridge (the boundary marker between La Union and Pangasinan).
