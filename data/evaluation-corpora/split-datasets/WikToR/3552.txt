Lazo (Лазо́ ) is a village in the Russian Maritime Province of Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East. The village was founded and named Monomakh Slobidka (Мономахова Слободка) in 1907 by settlers from Bryansk and Chernihiv. In 1933 it was renamed Vangou (Вангоу). On 26 August 1949, by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the village was renamed again, now becoming Lazo (Лазо) in honour of the revolutionary hero Sergey Lazo (1894 - 1920). At the same time the Sokolov District in Primorski Krai was renamed as the "Lazovsky District". On 2 July 2007 the administrative head office for the "Call of the Tiger" National Park was established in Lazo, at Lenin Street 23. Lazo hit the headlines internationally at the end of 2005 when it was reported that a stray dog was killed by squirrels in a Lazo park. The dog had barked at the squirrels who were alleged to be in a state of heightened frustration due to the absence, that year, of pine cones in the trees.
