Belmont is a village in Belmont County, Ohio, United States. It is part of the Wheeling, West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 453 at the 2010 census. Belmont was originally known as Wrightstown, and under the latter name was laid out in 1808 by Joseph Wright. The name was switched to Belmont in anticipation of being the county seat of Belmont County. St. Clairsville, however, was given the honor of having Belmont County's center of government. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad cut through the town until its dismantling in the 1980s. Belmont has recently undergone a public sewer project that will enable the village to have sustainable growth and more business development. Belmont is located at 40°1′39″N 81°2′27″W (40.027560, -81.040807). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.27 square miles (0.70 km2), all land.
