Lismore (Irish: Lios Mór, meaning "great ringfort") is an historic town in County Waterford, in the province of Munster, Ireland. Since December 2015 significant improvements to the frequency of the Local Link (formerly known as Déise Link) bus service are in effect. A bus shelter has also been provided in the town. There are now four services a day each way Mondays to Saturdays inclusive to Dungarvan via Cappoquin including a commuter service. Connections to Waterford and Rosslare Europort can be made at Dungarvan. In the other direction there are four services to and from Tallow where connections can be made for Fermoy. On Saturdays a local bus company operate a service to Cork. On Sundays Bus Éireann route 366 links Lismore to Dungarvan and Waterford. This route only operates on Sundays and comprises a single journey in one direction (no return service on any day of the week). Lismore formerly had a rail station on the now dismantled Waterford to Mallow line and was served by the Cork to Rosslare boat train. The line and station closed in 1967 though the station is still extant.
