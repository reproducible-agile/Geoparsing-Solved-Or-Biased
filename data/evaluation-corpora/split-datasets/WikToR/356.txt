Kingston is a Canadian city in Eastern Ontario located where the St. Lawrence River flows out of Lake Ontario, and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River (south end of the Rideau Canal). It is located midway between Toronto and Montreal. Growing European exploration in the 17th century and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade led to the founding of a French trading post known as Fort Frontenac in 1673. The fort became a focus for settlement. Kingston was named the first capital of the Province of Canada on February 10, 1841. While its time as a political centre was short, Kingston has remained an important military installation. Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998. Kingston is now a separated municipality from the County of Frontenac. Kingston is nicknamed the "Limestone City" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone. Archaeological evidence suggests that Native peoples lived in the Kingston region as early as the Archaic Period (about 9,000–3,000 years ago). Evidence of Late Woodland Period (about 1000–500 AD) early Iroquois occupation also exists.
