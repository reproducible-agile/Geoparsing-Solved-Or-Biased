Retiro is a town and commune in Chile, located in Linares Province, in the seventh region of Maule. Retiro is located 335 km (208 mi) to the south of Santiago, 27 km (17 mi) to the south of the city of Linares (the provincial capital), and 15 km to the north of the city of Parral. The municipality has a surface of 827.1 km2 (319 sq mi) and is bordered by San Javier and Longaví on the north, by Parral on the south, by Cauquenes (Province of Cauquenes), on the west and by Longaví on the east. The commune was founded officially on December 22, 1891. President Ramón Barros Luco owned a manor house in this area. Retiro was, therefore, visited frequently by well-known politicians and statesmen of the time, and in general by those that contributed to the decision-making process in the country affairs. The name of "Retiro" (Retirement) was given to the commune on account of being the place of retirement - leisure - of President Barros Luco.
