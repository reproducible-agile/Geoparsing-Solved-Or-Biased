Bora is a village in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab, India. Bora is located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) east of Garshankar. It is situated on the Garhshankar - Sri Anand pur Sahib Road. Bora celebrates all Hindu and Sikh fesivals, including Diwali, Holi, Gurpurab, and Raksha Bandhan, but Janamastami is the most popular festival in the village and is celebrated with great pomp and show by Hindus and Sikhs. On this day Sri Mahakali temple is decorated and the goddess Mahakali is worshipped with prasad prepared by the temple administrators and offered to the goddess. In the 19th century there was a great confusion among the villagers that on which day Mahakali should be worshipped. The people of the Digpal gotra suggested that this holy ceremony should be done on the day of “Janamashtami”. Bora is home to several temples: Sri Mahakali Temple Sri Sai Baba Temple (Gugga Zahir Peer) Sri Gugga Marhi Temple Shivalya (Shiv Mandir) Do Lathian Wala Mandir (Shivalya) Bagge Da Mandir There is also a Sikh gurudwara named Gurudwara Chhevi Patshahi Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji.
