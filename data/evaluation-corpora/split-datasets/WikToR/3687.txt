Denton is a village and civil parish in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated approximately 3 miles (5 km) both south-west from the market town of Grantham, and west from the A1 road. The Denton name derives from the Old English 'dene+tun', meaning "village in a valley," but in Domesday it is written as "Dentune". Denton is the site of an ancient Roman settlement. It may also be a site of the Beaker culture, based on some archeological finds made. Denton is situated just north off the main A607 road between Grantham and Melton Mowbray. Nearby villages include Harlaxton, Barrowby and Woolsthorpe. Denton is a 3 miles east from Belvoir Castle. The civil parish covers approximately 2,600 acres (11 km2). In 1984 Denton held its first street market, proceeds from which were equally divided between the Church, the School and the Village Hall. The street market is now held every year on the first Bank holiday Monday in May. The 2013 event was the 27th, (the 2001 and 2012 markets being cancelled because of foot and mouth and bad weather respectively) with over 150 stalls, food outlets, children's entertainment, and traditional village sports.
