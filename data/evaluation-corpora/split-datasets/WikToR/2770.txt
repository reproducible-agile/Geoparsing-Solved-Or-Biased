Atlanta is a village in Phelps County, Nebraska, in the United States. The population was 131 at the 2010 Census. During World War II the town was neighbored by Camp Atlanta, which housed more than 3,000 Nazi German prisoners of war over three years. The camp was said to house more prisoners during the war than the town had in its entire existence. Atlanta was laid out in 1883 when the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad was extended to that point. It was likely named after Atlanta, Illinois. In the first part of the 20th century Atlanta was home to several amenities for neighboring farmers. They included a grocery store, post office, cafe, and a tourist shop for drivers on U.S. Route 6, as well as corn and grain elevators and two gas stations. Chataqua groups entertained at the town hall, with annual events such as the Atlanta Institute, which was an annual fair. There were also free outdoor "picture shows", and the Atlanta Industry Day Picnic. The Atlanta schoolhouse had eight grades. At the beginning of WWII, there was one street about two blocks long, with only a few business buildings drooping and dwindling along its edges.
