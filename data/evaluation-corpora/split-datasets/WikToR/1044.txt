The city is named for Francis Marion, a brigadier general from South Carolina in the American Revolutionary War. Marion was founded in 1842 on land donated by Dr. John S. Gilliam. It was incorporated in 1844, and a post office was established in 1846. A railroad line from Blackford to Princeton was completed in 1887, and a depot was established at Marion. Originally owned by the Illinois Central Railroad, it has since been abandoned, which has enabled the construction of the Marion Rail Trail, a multi-use recreation trail.
