Karimabad (Urdu: كريم آباد‎) is the capital of Hunza Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan, northern Pakistan. Karimabad is also known as Baltit or Hunza. It is named after Prince Karim Aga Khan, the spiritual head of Shia Ismaili Nizari community. The Guardian ranked it as one of the five "Best Tourist Sites" in Pakistan. Both Baldit Fort and Karimabad village received the World Award of Tourism in 2000 when Indonesia, Australia, India and Britain and other countries competed. Karimabad town, located on the west bank of the Hunza River, is in the Northern Areas of the Pakistani-administered part of the Kashmir region, in a valley which is at 8,200 feet (2,500 m) elevation. The town is made up of stone walled steep sloping large terraces. The town was a caravan halting place for people who were traveling through the Hindu Kush mountains to the Vale of Kashmir. It is set amidst snow clad mountain peaks of Rakaposhi (altitude of about 25,000 feet (7,600 m)), and glaciers like the Ulter Nala as a backdrop, and deep gorges. Access is by hill road from Gilgit.
