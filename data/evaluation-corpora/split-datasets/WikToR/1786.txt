Franklin County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, the population was 51,599. Its county seat is Malone. The county is named in honor of American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. Franklin County comprises the Malone, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area. Much of Franklin County is within the Adirondack Park. Its Canadian borders are the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. When counties were established in New York in 1683, the present Franklin County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Charlotte County, contained the eastern portion.
