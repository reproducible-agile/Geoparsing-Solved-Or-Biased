Santa Catalina, also known as the Vegetable Bowl of the North, is a fifth class municipality in the province of Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to the latest 2010 census, it has a population of 13,597 people. With an area of 968 hectares (2,390 acres) it is the smallest municipality in the province and the only municipality in Ilocos Sur which has an urban status for all its barangays based on National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB). The feast of the town is celebrated every 25th day of November to celebrate the feast day of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (town's patron saint). When the Augustinians were busy with the Christianization of the Ilocos Region, a group of missionaries sailed westward through the river known as "El Mestizo" to the place now called Santa Catalina. They were also looking for fresh water, since the area where he landed yielded only salty water. When they finally found a fresh water spring up north, and were busy quenching their thirst, some of them saw an image of a beautiful lady near the place where he drank, which disappeared after a few minutes. One of them recognized the image as that of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Augustinians returned to Villa Fernandina (Vigan) and reported this matter to their superiors. This resulted in the construction of a church in the town with Saint Catherine of Alexandria as the patron saint. It was also declared that Santa Catalina be the name of the town.
