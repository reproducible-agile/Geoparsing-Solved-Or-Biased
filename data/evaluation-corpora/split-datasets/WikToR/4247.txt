Compton or Compton Gifford is a suburb of Plymouth in the English county of Devon. Once a small village, it was developed in the 1930s and now lies between the suburbs of Mannamead and Efford. There are two parts, Higher and Lower Compton named after two farms and now distinguished by their respective public houses.

They may have been used by farmers, or dropped on route to other settlements. Around 800 AD, the Manor of Compton was appearing on maps, Coombe (a wooded valley) Ton (the Saxon word for farm).
