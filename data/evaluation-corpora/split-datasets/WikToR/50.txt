The birth of San Francisco has always been associated with the history of the provinces of Agusan and Surigao del Sur. Before San Francisco became the municipality that it is now, it was part of the District of Gibong, which was then governed by the late Deputy Governor Francisco Cataylo. During this period, the district comprised the barrios of Santa Ana, Caimpugan, Ebro, Borbon, La Caridad, Prosperidad, Azpetea and Los Arcos, with Santa Ana the seat of government. Like other barrios, Santa Ana comprised several sitios, including Sitio Hagpa, which was the site of the present day San Francisco. Hagpa was coined from a Manobo word for “swampy” as the sitio was a small village nestled along the Adlayan River and inhabited by Manobo tribes.
