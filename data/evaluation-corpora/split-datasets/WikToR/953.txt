Springfield is a green and hilly inner-southern suburb of the South Australian capital city of Adelaide. It is located in the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, around 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south-east of the Adelaide city centre. The suburb is part of the hills-face zone, with sweeping views over the Adelaide plains. Springfield is an affluent area containing many of South Australia's most valuable residential properties. Springfield is bounded to the North by the suburbs of Kingswood and Netherby, to the west by Torrens Park and Mitcham, to the south by Mitcham and Brown Hill Creek, and to the east by Leawood Gardens and Urrbrae. Situated on the east side of the Mitcham district, the land was first purchased from the crown in 1841 by Richard F. Newland, manager of the Bank of Australasia. By 1870, Charles B. Hardy was making extensive additions to a residence named "Springfield", laying out extensive gardens and adding to the acreage of the estate. Fifty years ago, the area was purchased from Mr. Frank Rymill by Springfield Limited which boasted a subdivisional design "entirely different from any previous scheme or organised suburban development in South Australia".
