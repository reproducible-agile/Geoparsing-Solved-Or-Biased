Woodstock is a suburban community on the outskirts of Chicago metropolitan area, located 51 miles (82 km) northwest of Chicago in the center of McHenry County, Illinois. Woodstock is the county seat of McHenry County. The population was 24,770 at the 2010 census. The city is the home to a historic turn-of-the-century town square, including the Woodstock Opera House and Old McHenry County Courthouse. The city was named one of the nation's Dozen Distinctive Destinations in 2007 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Centerville, as Woodstock was originally called, was chosen as the county seat on September 4, 1843, due to its location at the geographic center of McHenry County. Early area settler Alvin Judd developed a plat for the town, incorporating a two-acre public square, near which a 2-story frame courthouse and jail were constructed the following year by George C. Dean and Daniel Blair. In 1845, resident Joel Johnson's recommendation to give Centerville a more original name was met, and thereafter the town was known as Woodstock (after Johnson's hometown of Woodstock, Vermont). However, the town was listed as "Center" on the 1850 Federal Census. In 1852, Woodstock was incorporated as a village with Judd as President. In response to a burgeoning population following the Civil War, Woodstock was incorporated as a city in 1873. John S. Wheat was elected as Woodstock's first mayor. A vital artery for the growing town was the train line, which allowed for a substantial industrial presence early in the town's history.
