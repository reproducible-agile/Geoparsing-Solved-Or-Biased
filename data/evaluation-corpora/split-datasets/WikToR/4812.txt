Middleton is a ghost town in Montgomery County, Mississippi, United States. Originally located in Carroll County, Middleton was one of its earliest settlements. Once a thriving commercial and educational center, little remains of the original settlement but a cemetery. The first non-Native to settle at this site was Irelton C. DeVane, who in 1790 built a small log store used for trading with the Native people and with the occasional traveler. Other settlers included William Pace and his wife, who came from Kentucky in the 1820s. Mail was sent from the community by stagecoach as early as 1824. Following the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830, and the subsequent removal of the Native Americans from the area, many new settlers began to arrive. The "Little Log Store", located at the junction of the Carrollton and Shongalo roads, became a well-known trading post. The town was originally incorporated in 1837 as "Irwin", but was changed to Middleton in 1840. Unofficial names included "Oxford" and "Bowling Green". Several businesses opened during the 1830s, included two general merchandise stores, two doctors offices, a tavern, a furniture maker, a shoe factory, a large store called "The Big Store", a tailor, and a clock shop. Middleton's businesses were located around a town square, and the town had Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and Christian churches.
