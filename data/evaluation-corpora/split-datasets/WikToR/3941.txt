Both villages are among the most popular summer destinations of Achaea. Longos is 2 km east of Kamares, 4 km northwest of Rododafni and 7 km northwest of Aigio. The Greek National Road 8A (Athens - Corinth - Patras) runs southwest of the village. The "Longos Football Field" is located in the southwestern side of Longos village near Foinikas River.
