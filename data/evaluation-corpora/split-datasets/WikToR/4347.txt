Kular is a village in Firozpur District, Punjab, India. It is located in south western Punjab, lying in close proximity with the Rajasthan State's Hanumangarh and Sri Ganganagar districts. Many farmers of the village own land in both Punjab and Rajasthan. The village, unlike its other counterparts of Punjab, including neighboring villages, has a very low population of Sikh community. This is one of the bases on which neighboring Haryana lays its claim on the region, repeatedly denied by the Punjab government. The land here is very productive and though the average holding size is small-except for a few landlords holding huge estates with an annual turnover of crores of rupees-people in general are prosperous. Kular has a number of social amenities including a middle school by Punjab government, 3 private schools, a primary health center, a veterinary care center and a grain market. A community centre for the scheduled caste members has also been constructed. Kular has a prosperous agriculture with an elaborate irrigation structure, good water supply and good connectivity with the neighboring ago-markets. The soil is good enough to support 3 crops a year, which typically are- wheat and mustard in Rabi season, Cotton in Kharif season and another crop of maize or chickpea. Besides some vegetable farms are also there. Kular is a hub of Kinnow farming, specially taken up by large farmers.
