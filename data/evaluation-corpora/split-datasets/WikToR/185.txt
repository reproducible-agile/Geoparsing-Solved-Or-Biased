San Rafael is a first class municipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 85,921 inhabitants. San Rafael is politically subdivided into 34 barangays (5 urban, 29 rural). The Americans succeeded the Spaniards with their policy of benevolent assimilation. Schools were established as a potent factor for pacification. In 1903, schools were opened in San Rafael. The municipal building was used as a school house. Since then, with the supervision of the American administrators, San Rafael has enjoyed the education and the progress which was denied to them during the threeâ€“century rule of the Spaniards. In 1899, the Americans incorporated the town to Baliwag when Baliwag was intended to be the Provincial Capital of Bulacan. However, due to a number of petitions of the people of San Rafael, especially when the plan to make Baliwag the capital of Bulacan did not materialize, the Americans where convinced to separate San Rafael as an independent town from Baliwag. Mr. Julian V. Valte was appointed to be the first Presidente Municipal of San Rafael, and Mr. Emilio Reyes was the last.
