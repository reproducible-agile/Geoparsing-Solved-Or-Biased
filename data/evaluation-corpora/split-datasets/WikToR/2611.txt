Pontevedra (Galician: [ˌponteˈβɛ.ðɾa], Spanish: [ponteˈβeðɾa]) is a Spanish city in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. It is the capital of both the Comarca (County) and Province of Pontevedra, and of the Rias Baixas in Galicia. It is also the capital of its own municipality which is, in fact, often considered as an extension of the actual city. Pontevedra is the provincial district court seat. Pontevedra has transformed into one of the most accessible cities and has been awarded for its urban quality international prizes like the European prize, "Intermodes" in Brussels in 2013, the "ONU-Habitat" prize in Dubai in 2014 and the "Excellence Prize" of the Center for Active Design in New York in 2015. The name of the city is likely a Latin composite of pons, pontis (bridge) and veter, vetera, veterum (old, long established). In Galicia, Latin pons, a masculine word, became feminine, hence Vulgar Latin Ponte Vetera, which became by the 13th century the modern Galician language toponymy Pontevedra, "the old bridge", in reference to an old Roman bridge across the Lérez river, which had been located near the 12th century Burgo Bridge that remains in place today.
