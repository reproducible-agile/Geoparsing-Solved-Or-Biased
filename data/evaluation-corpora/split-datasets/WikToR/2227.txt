Monroe is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 788 at the 2010 census. The town is located along a bend of the Connecticut River, across from Barnet, Vermont. It was originally chartered as part of Lyman. In 1762 Colonial Governor John Wentworth issued a grant ("Number 11") to 64 persons obligated to clear, farm and settle one tenth of each of their parcels or forfeit the grant. Only two made the attempt but the charter was extended, in 1769, for another five years. Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named Lyman. In that same year, Wentworth also granted to one Colonel John Hurd (of Portsmouth part of the land which is today within the bounds of Monroe. The grant was named Hurd's Location and included five small islands in the Connecticut River, known as "Deer Islands," and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls. In addition to Hurd's Location, and the governor's 500 acres (2.0 km2), there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of Lyman located in "West Lyman," or the "Lyman Plain," now Monroe, making up less than 7,500 acres (30 km2) of the present area. A portion of Bath, to the south, was annexed in 1897.
