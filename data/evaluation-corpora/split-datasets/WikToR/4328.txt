Nashville is a ghost town in Lowndes County, Mississippi, United States. Located 1.4 mi (2.3 km) west of the Alabama state line, on the east bank of the Tombigbee River, Nashville was once an important shipping port and river crossing location. The site was settled by Daniel Young, a blacksmith, in 1824, and the place became known as "Young's Bluff". In 1833, a road was constructed west from Young's Bluff to intersect the Robinson Road (which connected the cities of Columbus, Jackson, and Natchez, and is the second oldest road in Mississippi), and another was constructed east into Alabama. Road traffic passed through the community and then crossed the river on a ferry owned by Young. Another early settler, Nimrod N. Nash, opened a store there, and then purchased Young's property in 1834. He renamed the town "Nashville", and sold lots to settlers. In addition to the successful ferry service, Nashville's stores supplied local farmers with goods, it had a post office established in 1837, and its port had facilities to store cotton until steamboats arrived in the late autumn-early winter, when water level would rise. Despite this, Nashville never experienced significant growth, and the town did not incorporate. It never had more than two stores, and in census of 1840, the population was about 55 whites, and an undetermined number of slaves.
