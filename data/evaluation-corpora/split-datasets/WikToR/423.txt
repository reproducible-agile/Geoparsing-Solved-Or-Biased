Paris is a city in Bourbon County, Kentucky, in the United States. It lies 18 miles (29 km) northeast of Lexington on the Stoner Fork of the Licking River. It is the seat of its county and forms part of the Lexingtonâ€“Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 8,553. Joseph Houston settled a station in the area in 1776, but was forced to relocate due to prior land grants. In 1786, Lawrence Protzman purchased the area of present-day Paris from its owners, platted 250 acres (100 ha) for a town, and offered land for public buildings in exchange for the Virginia legislature making the settlement the seat of the newly formed Bourbon County. In 1789, the town was formally established as Hopewell after Hopewell, New Jersey, his hometown. The next year, though, it was renamed Paris after the French capital to match its county and honor the French assistance during the American Revolution. The post office was briefly known as Bourbontown or Bourbonton in the early 19th century, but there is no evidence it was ever formally applied to the town itself. It was incorporated as Paris in 1839 and again in 1890.
