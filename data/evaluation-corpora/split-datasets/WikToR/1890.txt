Dore is a large village in South Yorkshire, England. The village lies on a hill above the River Sheaf which gave Sheffield its name, and until 1934 was part of Derbyshire, but it is now a suburb of the city. Dore is served by Dore and Totley railway station on the Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester. The railway tunnel between Dore and Totley under a limb of the Pennines to Hathersage in Derbyshire is the longest such in England, second only to the Severn Tunnel between England and South Wales. They are the longest main line railway tunnels anywhere in Great Britain - the London Underground and Channel Tunnel to France excepted, of course. Dore has long enjoyed a reputation of being Sheffield's wealthiest suburb, and Dore and Totley was the only ward of the city which regularly elected a Conservative councillor. However, as of May 2008 all three councillors were Liberal Democrats. The Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam constituency, of which Dore is part, is Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, who from 2010 until 2015 served as Britain's deputy prime minister in the Coalition government.
