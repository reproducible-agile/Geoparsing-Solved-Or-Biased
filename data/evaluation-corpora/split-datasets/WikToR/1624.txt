Newport is a suburb in northern Sydney, placed on Sydneys Northern Beaches in the state of New South Wales, Australia 31 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Pittwater Council. It is part of the Northern Beaches region. Newport derived its name from being a "new port" for steamers carrying passengers and cargo such as local shell lime and firewood. Bungan Castle is a medieval-style stone castle on Bungan Head built in 1919 by Adolph Albers, a German art dealer. Newport sits between the Pacific Ocean to the east and Pittwater to the west. Its ocean beach is patrolled by Newport Surf Life Saving Club. On the shores of Pittwater are several marinas and small shipyards, including the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club and the Royal Motor Yacht Club, serving mainly pleasure craft. Newport also features many cafes and restaurants, as well as the Newport Arms Hotel on the shore of Pittwater. Pittwater Presbyterian Church has been ministering to the people of Newport and the surrounding suburbs since 1767. In mid June 2014 Rob Lamont started as Ministry Coordinator after 23 years of ministry from Phil Rawlings. They meet on Sundays at 9am and 7pm
