Guide is a village on the edge of Blackburn, in Lancashire. It is located south of the town centre, and the M65 motorway passes around the south and east of the village with junction five situated immediately to the southwest of the village. People who were born and lived in Guide all of their lives are known as 'Guiders'. The traditional village pub, The King Edward, remains there. It is sited on a corner of the original crossroads. Also in the village is a Post Office, Cantonese restaurant and a Working Man's Club which features artists and is available for private hire. There are a number of industrial and office buildings in the area, many of which have been built since the motorway was extended. Residents of the village have protested against the increasing industrial development of the area. The Guide reservoir was surrounded with countryside and now features a new pub called The Willows, DW Sports Soccerdome & Gym. The main roads in the village were originally Haslingden Road (the former B6232), Blackamoor Road, and School Lane (both B6231). As part of the M65 extension work which was completed in 1997, a section of Haslingden Road, including the crossroads, was bypassed and the road became part of the A6077, which connects Blackburn town centre to the motorway.
