Houston is a borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,314 at the 2000 census. Students in Houston and neighboring Chartiers Township attend school in the Chartiers-Houston School District. Houston is located at 40°14′59″N 80°12′37″W (40.249790, -80.210275). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), all of it land. The land on which this town stands was part of a tract purchased from John Haft on January 24, 1827, by Daniel Houston, a near relative of Gen. Sam Houston, leader of the Texans in their war for independence from Mexico. After the Chartiers Valley Railroad was completed through that section in 1871, David C. Houston, a son of Daniel Houston, saw the possibilities of a town at that point and laid out the present plan of Houstonville. The first house in the new town was completed in the summer of 1871 by A. T. Haft and the second by J. C. Johnson. A few years later H. E. Riggle laid out a plan adjoining which was called Riggletown until the Borough of Houstonville was incorporated on May 13, 1901.
