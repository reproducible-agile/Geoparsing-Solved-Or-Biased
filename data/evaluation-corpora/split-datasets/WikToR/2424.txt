Belaya Gora (Russian: Бе́лая Гора́; Yakut: Үрүҥ хайа) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Abyysky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia, located on the right bank of the Indigirka River, approximately 20 kilometers (12 mi) downstream of its confluence with its tributary the Uyandina, opposite of the selo of Suturuokha. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 2,245. Within the framework of administrative divisions, Belaya Gora serves as the administrative center of Abyysky District. As an administrative division, the urban-type settlement of Belaya Gora is incorporated within Abyysky District as the Settlement of Belaya Gora. As a municipal division, the Settlement of Belaya Gora is incorporated within Abyysky Municipal District as Belaya Gora Urban Settlement. Belaya Gora is not connected to the outside world by any year-round roads. A winter road following the Indigirka, partially on the ice of the river when frozen, passes through, allowing for travel downstream to Chokurdakh and upstream to Ust-Nera via Khonuu. Another route exists, which leads west from Belaya Gora, up the valley of the Uyadina, to the mining settlement of Deputatsky; however, this route is no longer maintained.
