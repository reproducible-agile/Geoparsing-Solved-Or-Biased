Cook County is a county located in the U.S. state of Minnesota. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,176, making it the fifth-least populous county in Minnesota. Its county seat is Grand Marais. The Grand Portage Indian Reservation is entirely within the county. The first inhabitants of what is now Cook County, Minnesota were the Ojibwe people. The first non-Native Americans to ever set foot in what is now Cook County, Minnesota were French fur traders. Few of them remained permanently as year-round residents of the area and by the 1830s the French population of what is now Cook County numbered less than fifty. In the 1830s migrants from New England began moving to what is now Minnesota. These were “Yankee” settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the colonial era. While most of them came to Minnesota directly from New England, there were many who came from upstate New York. These were people whose parents had moved from New England to upstate New York in the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution. Due to the prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Minnesota was very culturally contiguous with early New England culture for much of its early history.
