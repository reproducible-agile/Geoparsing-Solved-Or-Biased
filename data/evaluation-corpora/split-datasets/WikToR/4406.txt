Coldstream is a district municipality in British Columbia, Canada, located at the northern end of Kalamalka Lake in the Okanagan Valley. Incorporated on December 21, 1906, Coldstream celebrated its centennial in 2006. The municipality is directly southeast of Vernon and is considered part of Greater Vernon. It is a member municipality of, and also the location of the head offices, of the Regional District of North Okanagan. Coldstream is best known for the Coldstream Ranch, established in 1863 by Captain Charles Frederick Houghton. He transferred the ranch to Forbes G. and Charles Albert Vernon who in 1891 sold it to John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, future Governor General of Canada (1893–1898). The ranch was purchased by its current owners in 1994 and continues to be a working cattle ranch. Coldstream is governed by a seven-member council, led by Mayor Jim Garlick. The Member of Parliament is Mel Arnold (Okanagan—Shuswap) and the Member of the Legislative Assembly is Eric Foster (Okanagan-Vernon). The Greater Vernon area was once based in forestry and agriculture. However, manufacturing, retail trade and services are now the primary industries. A form of suburbs also lies within Coldstream, known as Middleton Mountain. This is one of the more expensive areas to live in Coldstream, and it is located just above the North end of Kalamalka Lake.
