Rama (also called Mai Lala, Lala) is a town in northern Ethiopia. Located 35 km north of the town of Adwa and 7 kilometers from the border with Eritrea, in the Mehakelegnaw (Central) Zone of the Tigray Region, this town occupies a fertile lowland area and has a latitude and longitude of 14°25′N 38°47′E with an elevation of 1385 meters above sea level. It is the administrative center of Mereb Lehe woreda. Rama was recently the site for a pilot project for providing electricity to rural inhabitants, which has been a challenge for African governments, since villages in rural areas are often difficult to connect to national electricity grids. Since the project started in 2007, Rama has 2,100 houses with solar panels, and as of July 2009 there are 300 more requests for new solar home systems in Rama. One panel powers about four lamps, and the energy can also be used for radios and tape recorders. A point of interest in Rama is the nearby church, Kor Nebir Mikael. Records at the Nordic Africa Institute website provide details of a primary school in Rama in 1968.
