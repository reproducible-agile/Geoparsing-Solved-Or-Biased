Clinton (also known as Port Clinton) is a coastal township on Yorke Peninsula, South Australia. Located in the north west head of Gulf St Vincent, it is 130 km south of Port Pirie and 125 km from the Adelaide city centre. The first European occupiers were leaseholder pastoralists. In 1854 in what is now the northern parts of the Hundred of Clinton, W. & A. Rogers leased 75 square miles at an annual rental of ten shillings per square mile. In 1860, near the centre of the Hundred, T. & W. Day leased twelve square miles. The Hundred of Clinton was proclaimed on 12 June 1862, comprising 137 square miles. The port was surveyed that same year, with a jetty being erected in 1863. Surveys and closer settlement by farmers soon followed, along with land clearing of the mallee woodland. This was an important and busy port in the 1860s and 70s, being a transfer point for goods and passengers travelling between Port Adelaide and the copper mines at Wallaroo and Moonta. That was despite the shallowness of the beach, which closed the port to larger vessels during low tide. Clinton began a gradual decline after 1878 when the railway between Wallaroo and Adelaide was completed. The jetty was dismantled in 1916.
