Pacheco is a census-designated place (CDP) in Contra Costa County, California, United States. The population was 3,685 at the 2010 census. It is located 5.5 miles (9 km) north of Walnut Creek. This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Pacheco has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps. The town was laid out in 1857 by Dr. J.H. Carothers and named for Salvio Pacheco, grantee of the Rancho Monte del Diablo Mexican land grant. A post office operated at Pacheco from 1859 to 1913 and from 1955 to the present. Pacheco was briefly a prosperous commercial center. During this period, Pacheco Slough was deep enough to receive ocean-based shipping. A series of fires and floods, as well as an earthquake, destroyed the town and filled the Slough with silt during the 1860s. Pacheco was subsequently depopulated by the attraction of the nearby town of Todos Santos, later to be known as Concord.
