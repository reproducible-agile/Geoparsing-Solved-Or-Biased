Elizabeth is an outer northern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the City of Playford. Before the 1950s, most of the area surrounding today's suburb of Elizabeth was farming land. After the end of the Second World War with its shortage of materials, the state government decided that South Australia needed to grow and become industrialised. A "satellite city" was planned for the Elizabeth area, and the South Australian Housing Trust initiated a housing development program in the area, with a purchase of 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) of rural land between the older "country towns" (now Adelaide suburbs) of Salisbury and Smithfield. The Suburb of Elizabeth was formed on 16 November 1955, being named after Queen Elizabeth II, who visited the suburb in 1963. As well as the Town Centre, originally with open air shopping malls there was a theatre (named "The Octagon"), Elizabeth is the seat of the Playford local government area and thus acts as a central business district for the surrounding suburbs. It lies between the Gawler Central railway line and Main North Road. DSTO Edinburgh is located to the west of Elizabeth.
