Mina is a census-designated place in Mineral County in west-central Nevada, United States. It is located along U.S. Route 95 (38° 23' 25" N 118° 06' 30" W) at an elevation of 4,560 feet (1,390 m). The 2010 population was 155. Mina was founded as a railroad town in 1905 and was named for Ferminia Sarras, a large landowner and famed prospector known as the 'Copper Queen.' The Nevada & California Railway, a division of Southern Pacific Railroad, had a station in the town. The railroad is long gone, but at one time a local shuttle called the "Slim Princess" allowed native Americans to ride for free on top of the railcars, and passengers and crew would shoot wild game such as jack rabbits, ducks and sage hens from the open windows. The train moved slow enough that hunters had time to retrieve their game and hop back on board. Gee Jon and Hughie Sing were convicted of the August 27, 1921, Mina, Nevada murder of Tom Quong Kee and, as a result, Gee Jon, a 29-year-old member of the Hop Sing Tong, became the first person in the world executed by lethal gas. The execution was at the Nevada State Prison on February 8, 1924.
