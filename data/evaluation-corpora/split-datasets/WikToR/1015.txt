Somerset is not to be confused with Somerset County, Maryland, which has no relationship with the town; the two are about 150 miles apart. Somerset is located at 38°58′2″N 77°5′41″W (38.967110, -77.094824). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.28 square miles (0.73 km2), all of it land. Somerset's history dates back to 1890, when five government scientists purchased 50 acres (20 ha) parcel of tobacco farmland from the government for the purpose of setting up a residential community. This land was originally part of the Friendship Tract, a 1713 gift of 3,000 acres (12 km2) to a couple of early Maryland colonists which is now the basis for the nearby Friendship Heights area. Five early streets were arranged and remain to this day: Dorset, Warwick, Surrey, Cumberland, and Essex after the English counties. The first home in Somerset was occupied by Dr. Charles A. Crampton in 1893, and by 1905 there were 35 residences.
