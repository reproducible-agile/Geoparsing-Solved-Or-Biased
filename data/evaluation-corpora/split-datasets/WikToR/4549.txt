During the monsoon period, the sky is cloudy, but there is very little precipitation. The climate in summer is generally moist and humid. The cold weather in Badin starts from the beginning of November when a sudden change from the moist sea breeze to the dry and cold north-east wind brings about, as a natural consequence, an immediate fall in temperature.cyclones and floods are hit because of sea.
