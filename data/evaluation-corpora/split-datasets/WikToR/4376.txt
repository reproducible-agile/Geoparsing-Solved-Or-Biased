Barka (Arabic: بركاء‎) is a coastal city in the region Al Bāţinah, in northern Oman. The town is emerging as a tourist resort. Nearby is Bait Na'aman (Nu'man), a four-towered fort of the 17th-century iman Bil'arab bin Sultan, renovated in 1991. The town is also known for "bull butting," a pushing contest between specially raised great Brahmin bulls, and for its halwa confectionery. There are two major resorts in Barka, the Al-Sawadi resort and the Al-Nahda resort. In addition, a new quarter is now under construction in Barka, called "Blue City" (المدينة الزقاء), located in Sawadi. The development is 8 km from Sawadi beach, and many international companies are involved in Barka development projects. There is an estimated $15 billion in new construction currently taking place in Barka. Stores Lulu Hypermarket Mars Hypermarket and shopping centers.
