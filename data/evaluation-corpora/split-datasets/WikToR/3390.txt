Kanna (神流町, Kanna-machi) is a town located in Tano District of southwestern Gunma Prefecture in the northern Kantō region of Japan. As of February 2015, the town had an estimated population of 2,007 and a population density of 17.5 persons per km2. Its total area was 114.6 km2. The town has seen a precipitous drop in population, to only one third of its population in 1970, with the remaining population having the second oldest median age in Japan after Nanmoku, Gunma and is thus classified as a Genkai shūraku. A footprint of Japan's first dinosaurs was discovered in former Nakasato village, now part of Kanna. Kanna is located in the southwestern portion of Gunma Prefecture, bordered by Saitama Prefecture to the south. During the Edo period, the area of present-day Kanna was part of the tenryō territory administered directly by the Tokugawa shogunate in Kōzuke Province. Kamikawa village and Nakasato village were established within Minamikanra District, Gunma Prefecture on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration. In 1896 Minamikanra District was united with Midono and Tago Districts to create Tano District. Kamikawa village was elevated to town status in 1926 and renamed Manba town. On April 1, 2003, Manba and Nakasato merged, forming the town of Kanna.
