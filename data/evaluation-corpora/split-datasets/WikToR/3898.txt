According to the Diccionario Español-Bisaya (1885), Danao means lago, laguna, pantano, estanque grande, avenida, campañas, etc. (lake, lagoon, freshet, large reservoir, arable land, field, etc.). Except that of a lake, all definitions of danao describe the municipality of Danao, with freshet being the most likely meaning. A freshet is either a sudden rise or overflow of a stream or river, or freshwater stream emptying into the sea. The Isumod river flowing near the town center of Danao may suddenly overflow and inundate a large portion of the town. The river joins the Wahig river and empties into the sea.
