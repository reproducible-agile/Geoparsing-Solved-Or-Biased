Malabo /məˈlɑːboʊ/ is the capital of Equatorial Guinea and the province of Bioko Norte. It is located on the north coast of the island of Bioko, formerly known as Bubis, by its autochthonous inhabitants, as Etulá and as Fernando Poo by the Europeans. The city has a population of approximately 187,302 inhabitants. The official languages of the city, as well as across the country, are Spanish (main language and practically the only one used), French and Portuguese. Malabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. Many buildings within the city are built in the style of colonial architecture from the times of Spanish rule, coexisting with modern buildings built since independence. The downtown streets, with a square design, reveal the ancient conception of modern city with pedestrian areas at all. The city also offers numerous green areas and leisure. This phenomenon causes a feeling of architecture attenuated by the low height of buildings in a combination of architectural Westernization and Africanism. Oyala is a planned city currently under construction, designed to replace Malabo as the capital. In 1844, when Queen Elizabeth II ruled after the regency of her mother Maria Cristina and Baldomero Espartero, in an attempt to modernize Spain and rescuing its heritage, Spain let him know the UK its desire to be of regain control of the colony and thus the island. It took another decade to implement this direct control. The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions were very successful. Both factors helped to change the attitude of Spain, in addition to internal reasons already alluded.
