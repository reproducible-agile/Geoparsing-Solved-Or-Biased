It is included in the Sheboygan, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is located in the Town of Plymouth, but is politically independent.

Mayor Don Pohlman was last reelected in April 2014. Plymouth was surveyed in 1835 by United States Engineers. One of whom was named Mullet, and the Mullet river was subsequently named after him. The first land sold to a private party was sold to an Englishman named John Law who had emigrated from London. It was sold to Law on August 13, 1836. The next sale was to another Englishman, also from London, named Thomas Margrave. Settlers continued trickling in and the town was organized on April 3, 1849. In the 1840s a group of immigrants arrived from Tioga County, Pennsylvania. The Thorpe family arrived from Hartford, Connecticut. They were of old New England ancestry. These immigrants being the original pool of settlers in Plymouth gave the region cultural continuity with New England. The town was named Plymouth, after Plymouth, Massachusetts, where the Pilgrims had landed in 1620.
