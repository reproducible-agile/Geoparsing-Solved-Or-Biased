Clinton is an unincorporated community situated on a peninsula in the middle of Clinton Lake in Douglas County, Kansas, United States. The town of Bloomington was settled in June 1854 but was not called as such until April 1855 when Harrison Burson applied to the U.S. Government for a post office. Within eight months of the area being settled some 530 settlers were in the area that would become Bloomington-Clinton. The people of Bloomington were greatly anti-slavery and helped slaves escape through the Underground Railroad. In early 1857, the north half of Bloomington was moved to a new location and the south portion of the town was renamed Winchester. Winchester was named after a city in Illinois as was Bloomington. Later in the year Bloomington acted to become an incorporated city with Winchester following suit four days later. Winchester was incorporated on February 20, 1857 under the name of Clinton. The present name is after Clinton, Illinois. Clinton and Bloomington quickly became rivals since they were only separated by about three miles. Bloomington started losing ground in 1858 when on August 30, the post office was moved to Clinton. Within the first five years of existence, Clinton constructed two schoolhouses, two churches and a town hall. In 1869, the Clinton Cemetery was established on land already used for a cemetery and is considered one of the oldest burial grounds in Douglas County.
