Ballan /bəˈlæn/ is a small town in the state of Victoria, Australia located on the Werribee River, 78 kilometres (48 mi) northwest of Melbourne. At the 2011 census, Ballan had a population of 2,774.

There were clashes between indigenous Australians and white settlers during settlement. Robert von Steiglitz stated in his journal
