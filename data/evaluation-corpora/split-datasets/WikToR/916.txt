Hampton is a developing township to the south of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom. The first two neighbourhoods to be complete are Hampton Hargate, which is home to a community of around 1,700 homes, and Hampton Vale, with approximately 1,900 homes. Each neighbourhood is based around its own local centre with community facilities, shops and primary school. Work is continuing on building a third neighbourhood at Hempsted, while planning is now underway on a fourth neighbourhood, the Hamptons, which, like other parts of Hampton, will have its own distinct character. Adjoining these is Hampton's central and commercial area where the Serpentine Green shopping centre, Hampton College secondary and primary schools, and two business parks - Cygnet Park and Kingston Park, are located. Eventually Hampton will have up to 8,500 new homes spread over its four local areas, with additional schools, local centres and leisure facilities, as well as commercial and retail areas providing more than 12,000 jobs. Construction started in 1996 and is scheduled to continue until at least 2023. Since the first arrivals to Holly Walk, Hampton Hargate, in 1997, more than 4,750 new homes have been built at a rate of up to 500 a year. More than 30 home builders and housing associations have built schemes, including around 900 units of affordable housing.
