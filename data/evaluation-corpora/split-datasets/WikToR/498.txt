Nazareth is a city in Castro County, Texas, United States. The population was 311 at the 2010 census, down from 356 at the 2000 census. Nazareth is located in eastern Castro County on the high plains of the Llano Estacado at 34°32′39″N 102°06′10″W. It is 12 miles (19 km) east of Dimmitt, the county seat, and 20 miles (32 km) west of Tulia. According to the United States Census Bureau, Nazareth has a total area of 0.36 square miles (0.94 km2), all of it land. The town of Nazareth was established through the efforts of a Catholic priest, Joseph Reisdorff, who moved to the site in 1902 with four farmers interested in purchasing land in the area. Father Reisdorff named his colony after the biblical Nazareth and advertised for settlers in several midwestern German Catholic newspapers. By September 1902 the first settlers had begun to arrive. A post office was established in 1903, and later that year the Catholic community finished building its first church. Nazareth had 71 residents by January 1904, and the town was platted latter that year. By 1905, in addition to the church, the settlement included a blacksmith shop, a store, and a school; when the community's cemetery was consecrated in 1906, it became the only Catholic cemetery in the area. For many years local church officials supplied what little government the community required.
