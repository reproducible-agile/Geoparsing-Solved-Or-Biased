Bellevue is an unincorporated area of Nashville, located roughly 13 miles southwest of the downtown area via Interstate 40. It is served by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County. In the 1950s, Bellevue was a small community which existed primarily to serve the needs of nearby farms. It was located mostly along the railroad tracks near the Harpeth River, and had only a few buildings such as a hardware store, post office, and a Masonic lodge hall. The suburbanization was made official when the United States Postal Service changed the designation of the office there from "Bellview, Tennessee" to a branch of the Nashville office in the late 1970s. Since the year 2000, Bellevue has grown in population and development in the already established areas along Old Hickory, and now it is becoming progressively more lit. It also has Boulevard and Hwy 70S, as well as in the more affluent developments off Tennessee State Highway 100. There are three commercial retail hotspots in the Bellevue area which are located near the Highway 70/I-40 interchange, at the intersection of Highway 70 and Old Hickory Boulevard; and near the intersection of Old Harding Pike and Highway 100.
