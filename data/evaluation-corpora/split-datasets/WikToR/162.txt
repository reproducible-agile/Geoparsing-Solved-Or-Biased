Banda is a town in Sindhudurg district in Maharashtra, India near the Goa-Maharashtra border. Banda is the last town of Mahrashtra state on Mumbai-Goa national highway (NH-17). Terekhol is main river on the bank of which Banda city is established. God Shree Bandeshwar and Goddess Shree Bhumika are the Main Temples in the Village. Apart from these temples, temples of Lord Vitthal, Hanuman are also in the town. The name of the village Banda is only because of the God Bandeshwar, a Jagrit Swayambhu Shivalinga.In ancient age the Banda was known as Adilabad due to reign of Adilshahi. Evidences of his reign can still be seen in the form of Redeghumat, Bailghumat and other ancient constructions in and around the town. Adil was defeated by Portuguese. During the time of Shivaji, name Adilabad got converted into Banda because of the deity Lord Bandeshwar. This 300+ years old Temple of Lord Bandeshwar is being renovated. All the devotees are contributing for the same. It is a very real faith that the Lord Bandeshwar can only be worshipped, by entering into the Garbhagriha, by Holy Priest that is the Brahmin of the Temple. To keep devine purity and holiness of the Temple, all the citizens of Banda follow this tradition very heartily and do not enter into the garbhagriha. There are total 12 Shivalingas inside the Garbhgriha of the Bandeshwar temple. There is various temples of other deities e.g.Bhumika, Ravalnath, Vetal, Ganapati, Maharingan etc. around the main Bandeshwar temple. Jatra is being celebrated in the month of December every year.
