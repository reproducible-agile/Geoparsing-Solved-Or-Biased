Randa is a municipality in the district of Visp in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. It is located between the Weisshorn and the Dom in the Matter Valley. Randa is first mentioned in 1305 as Randa. In 1819, the village was almost totally destroyed by the blast from a huge avalanche that fell nearby. In 1991, a portion of the village was flooded following a large rockslide from a cliff above the town. The village is popular for tourists wishing to visit the area, as it is reachable by car and rail, and has a campsite which offers a taxi service to Zermatt, a car-free town.
