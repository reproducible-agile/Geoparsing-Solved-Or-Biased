Goudi (Greek: Γουδί until 2006; Γουδή since 2006) is a residential neighbourhood of Athens, Greece, on the eastern part of town and on the foothills of Mount Hymettus. Its name descends from the 19th century Goudi family, who owned a large estate in the area. It was home to a large army camp of the same name (where the Trial of the Six defendants were executed in 1922), three university hospitals (Laiko and two children's hospitals) and the main campuses for the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Dentistry, of the Athens University School of Health Sciences. The area's main square is St. Thomas' Square, with the church of St. Thomas in its middle. The Goudi army camp was decommissioned and turned into parkland and sports facilities, hosting the badminton and modern pentathlon venues for the 2004 Olympic Games. During 2012, 'Goudi' became a catchcry during some political extremist rallies in Greece, with protesters chanting it to express their hostility to mainstream politicians who they perceived as traitors to the country during the Euro Crisis, alleging that they deserved a similar fate as the Trial of the Six defendants.
