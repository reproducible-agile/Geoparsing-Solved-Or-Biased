Nelson is a city in Pickens and Cherokee counties in the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 1,314. It is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. The city is named for John Nelson, early landowner, farmer, and rifle maker. A railroad line built in 1883 from Atlanta, through the valleys and mountain passes of Cherokee County to Nelson and Tate, made possible the development of large marble quarries. One of the largest marble veins in the world is in Pickens County, running at least 4 miles (6 km) long. It is a half-mile deep and almost that wide in places. Over 60 percent of the monuments in Washington, D.C. are made from Pickens County marble. The Marble Museum is located in the Nelson City Hall and features a year-round exhibit that includes "examples of fine marble and shows the history of marble mining in Pickens County." Many stone cutters and other workers who migrated from either Italy or Scotland in the early years of the industry settled in Nelson to work in the area's marble industry. Today the Georgia Northeastern Railroad operates between Tate, Georgia, and the CSX interchange at Elizabeth (Marietta) five days a week. The Georgia Marble rail lines at Tate and Marble Hill, and the Blue Ridge Scenic Railroad at Blue Ridge, Georgia are also operated by GNRR. Their website also states the "GNRR runs through a Georgia Marble facility that no is no longer served by rail" at Nelson.
