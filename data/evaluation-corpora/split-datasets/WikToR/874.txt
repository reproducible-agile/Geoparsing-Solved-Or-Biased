Dol (pronounced [ˈdoːl]; formerly: Štajngrob or Štajngrob ob Dreti) is a small settlement in the Upper Dreta Valley in the Municipality of Gornji Grad in Slovenia. Traditionally the area belonged to the Styria region and is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region. The name Dol is a common toponym in Slovenia. It is derived from the common noun dol 'small valley', referring to a local geographical feature. Dol was formerly known as Štajngrob or Štajngrob ob Dreti in Slovene. Before the settlement was renamed, Dol was the name of a hamlet of Štajngrob. The older name is derived from German but underwent folk etymology, in which the final element (originally German -grube 'depression, basin') was changed to Slovene -grob 'grave'. Dol is the site of a mass grave from the Second World War. The Ravni 2 Mass Grave (Slovene: Grobišče v Ravneh 2) is located above Dreta Creek, about 150 m south of the Prodnik farm. Together with the Ravni 1 Mass Grave in neighboring Gornji Grad, it contains the remains of 100 to 200 people executed by the Partisan command of the Fourth Operation Zone in the fall of 1944.
