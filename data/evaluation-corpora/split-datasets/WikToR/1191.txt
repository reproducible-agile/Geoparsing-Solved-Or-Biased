Excerpts from The Milan Standard of June 8, 1905 Marshall Baker Witter moved to Sullivan County in 1844. At that time Milan was known as the Pharsalia Post Office. The name was so hard to pronounce and so few people knew how to spell it that Mr. Witter sought an easier name. In his youth, having read the noted Milan Decree, a treaty among certain European countries he suggested the name Milan for the city, and it was unanimously adopted. After which, by act of the legislature, approved February 9, 1859, Milan was incorporated.
