Kawit (formerly Cavite El Viejo) is a first class urban municipality in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 78,209 people in a land area of 22.86 square kilometers. Kawit is the birthplace of Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the Republic of the Philippines. It is also the location of his home, the Aguinaldo Shrine, where independence from Spain was declared on June 12, 1898. From 1895 to 1897, he served as the town's chief executive. The name Kawit is derived from the Tagalog word kawit (hook) which is suggestive of its location at the base of a hookshaped shoreline along Manila Bay extending to the tip of Cavite City. Legend, however, gives another version on how the town got its name. One day a Spanish visitor asked a native blacksmith about the name of the village. The latter was busy at the time pounding on the anvil a piece of hot metal that looked like a hook. He hesitated to speak, not understanding what the stranger was asking, but when pressed for an answer, and thinking that he wanted to know what he was doing, he merely said kawit (hook). The Spaniards left muttering the word kawit. In the course of the time the word kawit evolved into "cauite," and finally "cavite".
