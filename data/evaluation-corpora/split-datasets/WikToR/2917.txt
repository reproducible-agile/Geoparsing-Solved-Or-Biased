Buffalo is a town and county seat of Harper County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,299 at the 2010 census. It was named after Buffalo Creek Valley, for which it is located. In 1907, the town was "staked out" and a post office was established with the name Buffalo, which was derived from nearby Buffalo Creek. In 1908, a county seat election gave title to Buffalo and it was incorporated in the same year. Buffalo's founders issued instructions for all buildings to be built of stone, thereby many of those structures survived the test of time. The Harper County Journal, consolidated from the Buffalo Republican and the Harper County Democrat, has been published weekly since 1924. Other early newspapers included the Buffalo News, the Buffalo Bugle, the Buffalo Republican and the Post. The population peaked in 1960 at 1,618. According to the United States Census Bureau, Buffalo has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.1 km2), all land.
