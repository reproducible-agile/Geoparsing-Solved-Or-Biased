Buffalo is a town in Putnam County, West Virginia, United States, along the Kanawha River. The population was 1,236 at the 2010 census. Buffalo is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Along with numerous sites in the Kanawha River Valley, Buffalo was originally settled by waves of ancient cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples. Clovis points indicate the presence of inhabitants more than 10,000 years ago. One of the last cultures, that of the Fort Ancient people, had a few villages such as Buffalo and Marmet that survived into the time of European exploration. Archaeologists have found European trade items among Fort Ancient artifacts. Historic tribes such as the Huron, from the Great Lakes region, and the Conoy (also spelled Conois and Kanawha) were driven out of the central valley by Iroquois' invading from their base in present-day western New York. Many of the Conoy by the early 17th century had resettled on the west side of the Chesapeake Bay and below the Potomac River. After decades of encroachment by English colonists, surviving Conoy (also called Piscataway by then) went north to Pennsylvania and allied with the Susquehannock and Iroquois.
