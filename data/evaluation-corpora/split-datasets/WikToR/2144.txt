Hollywood is a village in the Bromsgrove district of Worcestershire, England, contiguous with and to the south of the city of Birmingham. The village lies within the ward of Hollywood and Majors Green and is located within the civil parish of Wythall. The eastern part of the village is also known as Trueman's Heath. Until the 1950s, Hollywood was a rural area with many fields and farms. Extensive postwar development saw these fields and farms give way to housing estates, shops and schools. Hollywood is served by the A435 Alcester Road, and is adjacent to Highter's Heath to the north and Drakes Cross to the south. Other settlements close by include Wythall, Kings Heath, Kings Norton, Shirley and Dickens Heath. Hollywood is home to the Hollywood Golf Club, formally known as Gay Hill Golf Club which has existed since 1921, and a family owned and managed packaging company, Kilby Packaging, which has existed since 1946. The village is served by several schools located immediately outside the ward boundary - Hollywood Primary School is located over the county border within the Highter's Heath area of the city of Birmingham, whilst the Coppice Primary School and Woodrush School are just within the Drakes Cross ward.
