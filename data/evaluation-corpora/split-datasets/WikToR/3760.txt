Montgomery County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2010 census, the population was 172,331. The county seat is Clarksville. The county was created in 1836. Montgomery County is included in the Clarksville, TNâ€“KY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county was named for John Montgomery, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War and an early settler who founded the city of Clarksville. It was formed when Tennessee County, North Carolina, was split in 1796, when Tennessee became a state, to reduce confusion. The same year, much of the eastern portion of the county was combined with land taken from Sumner County to form Robertson County. Later acts of the Tennessee General Assembly further reduced the county to its current size and boundaries by 1871. Montgomery County was the site of several early saltpeter mines. Saltpeter is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from several local caves. Bellamy Cave, located near Stringtown, still contains the remains of two dozen saltpeter leaching vats and apparently was a large operation. Cooper Creek Cave also shows evidence of extensive mining and contains the remains of "many saltpeter hoppers". Both were probably mined during the War of 1812. Dunbar Cave is reported to have been mined for saltpeter during the Mexican War, but commercial development has destroyed any evidence of this. Little mining is likely to have happened here during the Civil War, since the Union Army captured this part of Tennessee in early 1862.
