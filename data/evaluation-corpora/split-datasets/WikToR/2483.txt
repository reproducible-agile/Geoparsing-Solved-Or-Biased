Berg is a municipality in Troms county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Skaland. Other villages include Finnsæter, Mefjordvær, and Senjahopen. The municipality was the first place in the world to utilize a hydroelectrical power station in the mining community of Hamn. When the mining industry ceased, the "electrical adventure" did as well. The buildings are still located at Hamn, now functioning as a special hotel/lodge. The first female pastor in the Lutheran Church of Norway, Ingrid Bjerkås, worked in this parish, starting in 1961. Berg was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The southern part of Berg (population: 1,229) was separated from Berg to form the new municipality of Torsken on 1 January 1902. This left Berg with 1,002 residents. The municipal borders have not changed since. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Berg farm (Old Norse: Berg). The name is identical with the word berg which means "mountain". The Church of Norway has one parish (sokn) within the municipality of Berg. It is part of the Senja deanery in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.
