Jefferson (also known as Owendale) is an unincorporated community within Cardston County, Alberta, Canada. It community is located approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) southeast of Cardston, which is home to Cardston County's municipal office. One of Jefferson's two services at this point in time is an unmanned postal box outlet (Rural Route 2 Site 10). It shares the same postal code as Cardston (T0K 0K0), and in fact, mail going to the Jefferson area is addressed to Cardston - as Jefferson-bound mail is sorted at Cardston - then delivered to Jefferson by Canada Post on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. There is a new Canada Post box installment after the old, green one was covered by debris when the neighboring abandoned Jefferson Garage collapsed in a windstorm in 2003. The garage had been abandoned for generations and the wooden structure had seemed to be on the verge of collapse for years. The now-flattened garage had been beside an old General Store, but that store was converted into a family home generations ago. The other service for the community is the Jefferson Waste Transfer Site, constructed in the 1980s to replace an old open-air dump that was located in a small gully two miles west of Jefferson. The newer Waste Transfer Site is located only about a quarter-mile east of Jefferson, and is manned only one day a week.
