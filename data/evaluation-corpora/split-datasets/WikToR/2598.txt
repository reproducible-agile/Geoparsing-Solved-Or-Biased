Most of the land of Lota was acquired by squatter and Irish-born politician William Duckett White in 1862, following sub-division of the lands from Lytton to Fig Tree Point (Lota). The suburb is named after Duckett White's house 'Lota House', built in 1863, in itself named after the family home of his wife, Jane, on Cork Harbour, County Cork, Ireland.
