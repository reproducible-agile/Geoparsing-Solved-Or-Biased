Jieshi (Chinese: 碣石镇) is a Town in Lufeng, Shanwei Municipality, Guangdong. The town administers 41 villages. Early in 2009 the Jieshi villages of Gangkou and Meitian began contesting the control of a road down to their common seaside. At one point, armed Meitian villagers surrounded Gangkou and attacked. The victims appealed to Jieshi Town executive / Party office to no avail. In April over 400 Gangkou residents boarded 26 fishing boats and sailed for Hong Kong. (The boats were turned back by Hong Kong police after a seven-hour protest near Clear Water Bay). Meitian also suffered assault. Some villagers posted claims on a local website that their houses had been pelted with bricks, their schoolchildren beaten, a teenager raped (in April). More violence came in October. On March 7, 2010, late in the evening, Meitian villagers again attacked Gangkou. They hurled rocks, rods, home-made grenades and petrol bombs at Gangkou residences through the night, destroying roofs and windows. All Gangkou residents fled and by morning were camped out before the Jieshi Town govt/party building.
