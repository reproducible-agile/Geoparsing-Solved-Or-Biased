See Hampton Township, New Jersey for the municipality in Sussex County Hampton is a borough in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 1,401, reflecting a decline of 145 (-9.4%) from the 1,546 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 31 (+2.0%) from the 1,515 counted in the 1990 Census. What is now Hampton was originally incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature as Junction Borough on February 20, 1895, from portions of both Lebanon Township and Bethlehem Township, based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day. By a resolution of the borough council, the name was changed to Hampton as of February 11, 1909. In 1931, additional territory was annexed from both Glen Gardner borough and Bethlehem Township. Located on the banks of the Musconetcong River, Hampton has changed little since it was first settled in 1800. In 1880, the town consisted of a store, hotel, cabinet manufacturer, blacksmith, wheelwright shop, grist mill, school house and about 25 dwellings. Hampton was once known as "Junction" because the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad crossed through here.
