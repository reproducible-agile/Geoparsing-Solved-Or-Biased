Wawa is a township in the Canadian province of Ontario, located within the Algoma District and associated with Wawa Lake. Formerly known as the township of Michipicoten, after a nearby river of that name, the township was officially renamed in 2007 for its largest and best-known community of Wawa. This area was first developed for fur trading. In the late 19th century, both gold and iron ore were found and mined, leading to the region's rise as the steel industry developed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. From 1900-1918 the Helen Mine had the highest production of iron ore of any mine in Canada. The township includes the smaller communities of Michipicoten and Michipicoten River, which are small port settlements on the shore of Lake Superior. These names are derived from the Ojibwe term for the river. Wawa's history is rich in mining, forestry, and the fur trade. Although mining attempts began as early as the late 1660s, it was not until 1896 that gold was discovered along nearby Wawa Lake. The population quickly grew from only a handful of people to approximately a thousand.
