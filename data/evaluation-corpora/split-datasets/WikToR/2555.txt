Punta Gorda (/ˌpʌntə ˈɡɔːrdə/; English: Fat Point) is a city in Charlotte County, Florida, United States. As of the 2010 census the city had a population of 16,641. It is the county seat of Charlotte County and the only incorporated municipality in the county. Punta Gorda is the principal city of the Punta Gorda, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area and of the Sarasota-Bradenton-Punta Gorda Combined Statistical Area. Punta Gorda, a small historic town nestled on the shores of pristine Charlotte Harbor, a large estuary off the Gulf of Mexico, is one of the oldest incorporated cities in Florida. Following a hurricane, which came through the city on August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley, a revitalization of the City took place that resulted in buildings being restored or built to hurricane resistant codes. The new buildings, restorations and amenities concurrently preserved the City's historic past while showcasing state-of-the art modern facilities and small city charm. During this time, Laishley Park and Marina was built and a waterfront path along the harbor Harborwalk, a Linear Park that winds through the city next to a scenic stream and various trails were created throughout the City for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
