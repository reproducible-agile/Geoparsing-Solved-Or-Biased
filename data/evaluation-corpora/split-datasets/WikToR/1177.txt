Nevada /nəˈveɪdə/ (local pronunciation is NevAYda) is a city and a county seat of Vernon County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,386 at the 2010 census, and 8,171 in the 2012 estimate. Nevada is the home of Cottey College. Before its incorporation in 1855, the small community was known as both Fair View and Hog-Eye. The second name was considered to be degrading, and the first name had already been used for the name of a post office in Fairview, Missouri. The town's name was changed to Nevada after Nevada City, California by circuit and county clerk DeWitt C. Hunter, for the city where he had been a miner. Vernon County suffered greatly during the Civil War. The entire town of Nevada was burned to the ground on May 23, 1863, by pro-Union militiamen from nearby Cedar County. A few days before that, a small force of Union militia from Cedar County had attacked the Nevada Courthouse. They were beaten back and all of them killed. When they failed to return home, a much larger force of militia marched on Nevada. They told the villagers that they had fifteen minutes to save anything they wanted; then their homes would be burned. The jail and several houses were all that escaped destruction.
