Glendale is an unincorporated community in Hardin County, Kentucky, United States. It is included in the Elizabethtown, Kentucky Metropolitan Statistical Area. Once named Walker's Station for Lewis B. Walker's store, when a post office was established in 1859, it was named Glendale for the new train station, which in turn was possibly named for the hometown of a railroad employee. Glendale is host to the annual Glendale Crossing Festival on the third Saturday of October. The festival is well known for the wide variety of antiques and crafts for sale. The Whistle Stop is the most famous restaurant in Glendale and is situated along the rail road. The Whistle Stop was created from expanding a lunch business within the existing hardware store in Glendale. The owners, James and Idell Sego, opened the restaurant in 1975. In 2005, this restaurant obtained new owners. Glendale has a special zoning regulation that keeps out businesses such as fast food restaurant chains from its core downtown business area. Glendale is located approximately 50 miles (80 km) from one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Mammoth Cave National Park.
