Billings (Russian: Би́ллингс) is a rural locality (a selo) in Iultinsky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. Population: 211 (2010 Census);  Municipally, it is incorporated as Billings Rural Settlement in Chaunsky Municipal District. Like Mys Shmidta, Billings is named after a nearby cape, which in turn was named after British Captain Joseph Billings (1758—1806) who was at the service of the Russian Imperial Navy during Catherine the Great's reign. The cape itself marks the point of separation between the Chukchi Sea and the East Siberian Sea. Joseph Billings was an English-born member of the Russian navy who in 1785, together with C. G. Sarychevym, was part of the expedition that mapped and researched the coast of North-Eastern Siberia. Using reindeer, he crossed Chukotka as far as Kolyuchinskaya Guba and mapped the area. The local Chukchi people originally called the place "Valkyran", meaning a dugout of whale jaws. This is in reference to the remains of an ancient Inuit camp consisting of a number of homes dug into the soil and constructed of wood and the bones of the Greenland whale.
