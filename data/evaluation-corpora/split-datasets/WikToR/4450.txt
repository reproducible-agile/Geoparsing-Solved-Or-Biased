Horn was a civil parish in the county of Rutland in the East Midlands of England. In 2001 it had a population of 9. The parish is part of the Exton Hall estate of the Earls of Gainsborough. The Parish of Horn with just three properties was amalgamated with Exton Parish in 2015. The village of Horn was mentioned in the Domesday survey, as 'Two hides in Horn of which Langfer had been tenant under Edward the Confessor were held of the king by the Bishop of Durham'. In 1287, Richard son of Richard de Seyton had a manor house at Horne and in 1378 Sir John Seyton had his capital messuage here, although the manor was reportedly valueless in 1376. The land was turned from arable to pasture, which has been suggested as the cause of depopulation. There had been a church, dedicated to All Saints, but it too fell into disrepair and new rectors were installed under a thorn tree in 1471, and until the last appointment in 1809. Horn is part of the Alstoe hundred of Rutland. Proximity to the parish meant that the Battle of Losecoat Field during the War of the Roses was once called the Battle of Hornfield.
