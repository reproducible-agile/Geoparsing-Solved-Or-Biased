Carmel (Hebrew: כרמל Karmel) is an Israeli settlement in south-east Har Hebron area of the West Bank, close by the Palestinian villagers of Umm al-Kheir, who settled there several decades ago after Israel expelled them from the Arad desert, and who purchased the land from residents in the Palestinian village of Yatta. According to David Shulman, Carmel lies on lands appropriated from the Bedouin of that village. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Har Hebron Regional Council and associates ideologically with the Amana settlement movement. The moshav was founded in 1980, next to the land on which the Hadaleen Bedouin tribe live, as a Nahal military-establishment, and was "civilianized" in 1981. Today, the settlement is home to approximately 70 families. The name Carmel was chosen due to the moshav's close proximity to the location of Biblical Carmel (Joshua 15:55), the home of Nabal. Carmel is mentioned in 1 Samuel 25:2 as the home of Nabal. The new settlement is expanding, and, according to one commentator, 'continuing to usurp the land of its neighbors, who lived at the site decades before the settlers arrived.'
