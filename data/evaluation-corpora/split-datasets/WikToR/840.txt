Ostrov (Russian: О́стров, lit. island) is a town and the administrative center of Ostrovsky District in Pskov Oblast, Russia, located on the Velikaya River, 55 kilometers (34 mi) south of Pskov, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 21,668 (2010 Census); 25,078 (2002 Census); 29,060 (1989 Census); 27,000 (1974). The name of the town, which means "island" in Russian, originates from the island on the Velikaya, on which the Ostrov fortress was originally built. It was founded as a fortress in the end of the 13th century and first mentioned in 1342. It had been an important military outpost throughout the 15th-16th centuries. The only time it was conquered was in 1501, by the Livonian Order after the Battle of the Siritsa River. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, it was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). Ostrov is specifically mentioned as one of the towns making the governorate. In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off and in 1772, Pskov Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as Pskov Viceroyalty) was established. Catherine the Great incorporated it as a town in 1777.
