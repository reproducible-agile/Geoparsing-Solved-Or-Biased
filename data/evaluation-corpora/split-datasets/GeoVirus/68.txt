The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed that a case of 'mad cow disease' (BSE) has been found in a dairy cow in central California. The disease is described as "atypical." None of the milk or beef from the cow made it to the consumption level. According to reports, the cow was found in a rendering facility where testing turned back a positive match for the disease. Clifford says the cow's carcass will be destroyed. It is currently being held in a rendering facility in California under state authority. "As part of our targeted surveillance system, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the nation's fourth case of BSE in a dairy cow from central California," said Clifford in a statement to the press. "Samples from the animal in question were tested at USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. Confirmatory results using immunohistochemistry and western blot tests confirmed the animal was positive for atypical BSE, a very rare form of the disease not generally associated with an animal consuming infected feed," he added. This is the fourth cow in the United States to test positive for the disease since December of 2003 when a cow from a Washington state farm, born in Canada, tested positive for the disease. According to the USDA statement, mad cow disease "is a progressive neurological disease among cattle that is always fatal. It belongs to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Affected animals may display nervousness or aggression, abnormal posture, difficulty in coordination and rising, decreased milk production, or loss of body weight despite continued appetite."
