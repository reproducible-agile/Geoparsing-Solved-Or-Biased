Health officials in the United Kingdom have confirmed that the H5N1 strain of the Avian Flu has been found in turkeys on Redgrave Park Farm in Suffolk, England. The farm is owned by Gressingham Foods. Officials also say that the commission for the European Union have been notified. In April of 2006, the deadly H5N1 virus was found in the remains of a wild Mute Swan in the village of Cellardyke in Fife, Scotland. In February, poultry producer Bernard Matthews' farm in Suffolk had more than 160,000 birds killed after they were infected with the H5N1 virus.
