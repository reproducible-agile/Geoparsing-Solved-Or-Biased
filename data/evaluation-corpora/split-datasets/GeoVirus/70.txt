Mosquitoes in East Providence and Barrington have tested positive for West Nile virus, according to Rhode Island state environmental officials. “..tests are an important reminder that people should protect themselves against mosquito bites by using bug repellant and window screens and getting rid of standing water, where mosquitoes breed, says Alan Gettman of the Department of Environmental Management.” These are the first cases of West Nile virus reported in Rhode Island this year. There have, however, been two cases reported in neighboring Massachusetts.
