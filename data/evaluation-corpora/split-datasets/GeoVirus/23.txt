North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, reported an outbreak of bird flu in the capital of Pyongyang. KCNA reported three separate outbreaks at poultry farms in the capital, and said hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. Radio Pyongyang said, "countermeasures are underway to prevent an epidemic and stem the spread to other poultry farms". Experts warned that a bird flu epidemic in North Korea would deprive the population of its main source of protein.
