Preliminary tests performed on samples taken from six villagers in the Kabanjahe district of Sumatra in Indonesia have tested negative for the deadly H5N1 Avian Flu virus. "Investigations by the ministry of health lab and Namru, too, on August 2 and 3 on all specimens collected from the suspected cases in Kabanjahe district came up negative," said Indonesia's health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari. Final test results are expected in at least seven days from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. "The World Health Organization (WHO) requires human samples to be sent to one of WHO's six collaborative centres. So, we only need to send them to CDC Atlanta as it has worked with the U.S. NAMRU-2 lab here," added Supari. Supari also stated that all individuals are suffering from the "common flu."
